Dear Martin, 
 
For dissemination to the market: 
 
CBA Instalments (CPUIYE series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in Computershare Limited (CPU) with ASX Codes CPUIYE, declared the record 
date for entitlements to the $0.23, 30% franked dividend for the CPU Commonwealth Bank 
Instalments to be 21 August 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 20 August 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the CPU ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of CPU Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from CPU on 16 
September 2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.computershare.com and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual 
circumstances.  
 
Should you have any queries, please contact your financial adviser or call CommSec on 13 15 20 
(8am to 5pm AEDT, Monday to Friday). 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
Equity Products Group 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia
