Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants

ASX announcement 
APRAs revisions to the related entities 
framework 
 
Tuesday, 20 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today notes the release by Australian 
Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) on revisions to the related entities framework for Authorised Deposit-taking 
institutions (ADIs).  
The reforms include broadening the definition of related entities, a reduction to the limits on exposures to related 
entities and revisions to the Extended Licensed Entities (ELE) framework. The new requirements will be effective from 
1 January 2021. 
APRA confirmed that, among other changes, it will reduce the limits for Australian ADIs exposures to related entities 
from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital.  
As previously disclosed, sufficient capacity exists under the reduced limits to accommodate CBAs exposures to its 
related entities, including the additional capital requirement for New Zealand banks proposed by the RBNZ.  
APRAs announcement is available at www.apra.gov.au.

ASX announcement 
Update on divestment of Australian life 
insurance business 
Friday, 23 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today announced that it has entered 
into further agreements to progress the planned divestment of its Australian life insurance business (CommInsure 
Life) to AIA Group Limited (AIA). 
 
The planned divestment has been subject to ongoing regulatory approval processes, which has led to an extended 
period of uncertainty for CommInsure Life. 
 
The revised transaction path comprises a joint co-operation agreement, reinsurance arrangements, partnership 
milestone payments and a statutory asset transfer. The aggregate proceeds for CBA from the transaction are 
expected to be $2,375m,1 a reduction of $150m from the original sale price. These arrangements are expected to be 
implemented in a staged manner throughout FY20, with CBA to receive approximately $750 million of proceeds and 
distributions by the end of 1H FY20 and the remaining $1,625 million by the end of FY20. 
 
CBA and ASB have also agreed to grant AIA an option to extend the respective Australian and New Zealand 
distribution agreements from 20 years to 25 years.  
 
CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said: Todays announcement provides CommInsure Lifes policyholders 
and staff with more clarity about the future of the business and progresses the simplification of CBAs portfolio of 
businesses. 
 
We are excited by the opportunity to bring together the strengths of AIA and CommInsure Life and are working hard 
with our partner to develop a new generation of products for CBAs customers, which will deliver excellent customer 
outcomes. 
 
The revised transaction path is subject to a number of Australian regulatory approvals, the entry into reinsurance 
arrangements and life insurance entity board approvals. 
 
Details of the revised transaction path 
The revised transaction path comprises the following key components: 
Joint co-operation agreement 
 
CBA and AIA will enter into a joint co-operation agreement, which once implemented, will result in the full 
economic interests associated with CommInsure Life (excluding in relation to the Groups 37.5% equity interest 
in BoCommLife Insurance Company Limited (BoCommLife)) being transferred to AIA and AIA obtaining an 
appropriate level of direct management and oversight of the business. AIA Australia & New Zealand CEO 
Damien Mu will lead CommInsure Life under these arrangements.  
 
Implementation of the joint co-operation agreement is expected before the end of 1H FY20 (Implementation 
Date), at which time CBA will receive an upfront payment of $500 million. 
                                            
1 Subject to completion adjustments.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 152/2019 
 
Reinsurance 
 
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (CMLA), the key life insurance entity of CommInsure Life, 
intends to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with a leading global reinsurer.  
 
The reinsurance arrangement would come into effect on the Implementation Date and is expected to result in 
CBA receiving a distribution from CMLA of approximately $200 million shortly following the Implementation 
Date. 
Partnership milestones  
 
CBA will receive four partnership milestone payments of $50 million each ($200 million in aggregate), to reflect 
the progress in the partnership, with the first payment expected to be received in late 1H FY20. 
Completion 
 
In parallel with the planned share sale of CommInsure Life (which remains subject to a foreign regulatory 
approval process), CBA and AIA are progressing a potential statutory asset transfer as an alternative approach 
to completing the divestment of the business. If implemented, the statutory asset transfer would be expected to 
take approximately 9 months to implement. 
 
Upon completion, whether achieved through a share sale or statutory asset transfer, CBA will receive a final 
payment from AIA of approximately $1,475 million (subject to completion adjustments). 
 
Financial impacts 
Upon completion, which is expected to occur by the end of FY20, the revised transaction path is expected to have 
released approximately $1.6 billion  $1.8 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, resulting in a pro forma 
increase to the Groups CET1 ratio of approximately 35  40 basis points on an APRA basis as at 30 June 2019. 
 
Sale of equity interest in BoCommLife 
CBA remains committed to completing the sale of the Groups 37.5% equity interest in BoCommLife to MS&AD 
Insurance Group Holdings. Completion of the sale of the BoCommLife equity interest remains subject to regulatory 
approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and CBA is working constructively 
with CBIRC in relation to the process. For the avoidance of doubt, the revised transaction path in relation to 
CommInsure Life does not impact this sale process and CBA will continue to exercise full control over the 
BoCommLife equity interest until its sale has been completed.

Dear Martin, 
 
For dissemination to the market: 
 
CBA Instalments (WESIYE series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in Wesfarmers Limited (WES) with ASX Codes WESIYE, declared the record 
date for entitlements to the $0.78, 100% franked dividend for the WES Commonwealth Bank 
Instalments to be 2 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 30 August 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the WES ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of WES Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from WES on 9 October 
2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.wesfarmers.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual 
circumstances.  
 
Should you have any queries, please contact your financial adviser or call CommSec on 13 15 20 
(8am to 5pm AEDT, Monday to Friday). 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
Equity Products Group

be 6 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 5 September 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the ASX ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of ASX Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from ASX on 25 
September 2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.asx.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual circumstances.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to invite you to attend the 
2019 AGM of the Commonwealth Bank 
ofAustralia. 
In the 2019 financial year we have 
made significant progress on our 
strategy to become a simpler, better 
bank and have been addressing key 
governance, accountability, risk and 
remediationissues.
Becoming a simpler, better bank
We are becoming a simpler, more focused 
bank that is aligned to meeting the needs 
of customers in our core markets. This 
year our focus has been on our Wealth 
Management division where we have  
been remediating past issues and  
making progress on our plans to exit  
our wealthbusinesses. 
We sold our New Zealand life insurance 
business, Sovereign, in July 2018 for 
$1.3billion; and in August this year, 
completed the sale of our global asset 
management business, Colonial First  
State Global Asset Management 
(CFSGAM), for $4.2 billion.
We are making progress on the sales of 
our life insurance businesses in Australia, 
China and Indonesia. We are also exiting 
our aligned financial advice businesses. 
We expect the sale of Count Financial to 
complete in October, are ceasing our  
CFP-Pathways business, and have 
commenced the assisted closure of 
Financial Wisdom. By simplifying our 
portfolio of businesses we are reducing 
risk and cost and creating the capacity 
toinvest in our corebankingbusinesses.
We have also been working to become 
a better bank, and to deliver better 
outcomes for our customers. This year, we 
have been committed to fixing past failings 
and to compensating impacted customers 
quickly. To deliver on our purpose of 
improving customers financial wellbeing 
we have been removing and reducing 
fees and charges, and have introduced 
smart alerts to help customers avoid fees. 
Improvements have also been made to the 
way we listen and respond to customers, 
including the implementation of a more 
robust complaints handling process. 
Executive leadership
This financial year marks the first full 
year of Matt Comyn as Chief Executive 
Officer of the Bank. Matt has built a new 
experienced leadership team that is 
working to deliver cultural change and the 
Banks strategy. 
Governance, culture and accountability
Much work has been done to strengthen 
governance, culture and accountability 
at the Bank. Most recently, this work has 
been guided by the recommendations 
of last years Australian Prudential 
Regulation Authority (APRA) Prudential 
Inquiry into CBA and we have been 
working systematically to deliver all of the 
milestones in the resulting APRA-endorsed 
Remedial Action Plan. The key focus this 
year has been to improve the governance 
and management of non-financial risk, 
including operational risk and compliance. 
We have implemented the Banking 
Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR).

For personal use only
We have also been making changes 
to our business in response to the 
recommendations of the Final Report of 
the Royal Commission into Misconduct in 
the Banking, Superannuation and Financial 
Services Industry. As the supporting 
legislative and regulatory changes are 
made, we will continue to work with our 
regulators and government to implement 
the recommendations. 
Remuneration
Remuneration plays an important role 
in reinforcing the achievement of the 
Banks priorities. Over the past three 
years, remuneration consequences 
and changes to our performance and 
remuneration framework reflect a strong 
focus on reinforcing greater accountability, 
to support cultural change and better 
customer and risk outcomes across  
the Bank.
Over the 2017 and 2018 financial years 
there was a reduction of more than  
$100 million in remuneration outcomes 
for Directors, Executives, senior leaders 
and employees. These consequences 
were applied to reinforce individual and 
collective accountability for the reputation 
of the Bank, the findings of the APRA 
Prudential Inquiry, and poor customer and 
risk outcomes.
This financial year we have continued 
to add more rigour and challenge to 
the risk assessment process which is 
a key consideration when determining 
remuneration outcomes. Of the 15 
Executives eligible for a short-term 
variable remuneration award, 14 received 
in-year reductions in relation to risk and 
reputational matters, including the CEO.
All Group Executives also experienced a 
reduction in their variable remuneration 
outcomes due to shareholder and 
customer outcomes, including as a 
consequence of the impact of customer 
remediation provisions on this years 
financial performance.
Sustainable business practice
We are committed to acting sustainably 
and responsibly in the long-term interests 
of the economy and broader community.
This year we have integrated our 
environmental and social commitments 
into a single Group Environmental and 
Social Policy. This policy includes our 
commitment to supporting the responsible 
global transition to net zero emissions 
 including by reducing our exposures 
to thermal coal mining and coal fired 
power generation, with a view to exiting 
the sectors by 2030, subject to Australia 
having a secure energy platform. The 
policy also incorporates our human 
rights commitments and our approach to 
managing the risks of modern slavery in 
our business operations and supply chains.
Financial performance
In the 2019 financial year, the Bank 
reported a net profit after tax of 
$8,571million on a statutory basis and 
$8,492million on a cash basis.1 
While this years result has been impacted 
by the actions we have taken to deliver 
better customer and risk outcomes 
 including customer remediation 
costs, revenue forgone for the benefit 
of customers, and elevated risk and 
compliance costs  it also reflects the 
continued performance and strength of 
our underlying business. The strength of 
our balance sheet was particularly evident 
this year. As at 30 June 2019, our Common 
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 10.7%, 
above APRAs unquestionably strong 
benchmark of 10.5%. The sale of CFSGAM 
in August has since delivered a further 
68basis points of CET1. 
This performance has enabled the  
Board to declare a final dividend of 
$2.31per share, taking the full year 
dividend to $4.31per share fully franked, 
flat on last year. The final dividend is 
payable on 26 September 2019.
Board renewal
In January, we welcomed Professor 
Genevieve Bell and Paul OMalley to 
the Board. Both will stand for election 
at this AGM with the support of the 
Board. Current Non-Executive Directors, 
MaryPadbury and Shirish Apte, will stand 
for re-election, again with the support of 
the Board. 
Sir David Higgins will retire from the Board 
on 31 December 2019, after more than five 
years of service. I would like to thank Sir 
David for his commitment and contribution. 
Paul will succeed Sir David as Chairman 
of the People & Remuneration Committee 
from 1 January 2020.
Items of business 
The Notice of Meeting for the AGM 
commences on page 8 of this document 
and outlines the items of business that we 
will put to shareholders for consideration. 
Background information on these 
items is contained in the Explanatory 
Memorandum on pages 10 to 15, which

ITEM 3
Adoption of the 2019 Remuneration 
Report
Section 250R of the Corporations Act 2001 
(Cth) (Act) requires a listed company to 
put a resolution to shareholders to adopt 
its Remuneration Report for the relevant 
financial year. 
The Companys Remuneration Report for 
the financial year ended 30 June 2019 can 
be found at pages 82 to 108 of the 2019 
Annual Report. It sets out the performance 
and remuneration for the Companys 
KMP (who comprise the Companys 
Non-Executive Directors, the Managing 
Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
Group Executives, the CEO ASB and 
OtherExecutives1).
The Companys remuneration framework 
is designed to align executive and 
shareholder interests, retain talent and 
support long term value creation by 
providing employees with competitive 
remuneration and rewards for sustainable 
long term performance. The Board 
obtains independent advice on the 
appropriateness of these arrangements. 
The Board also recognises the pivotal role 
that remuneration can play in managing 
risk, contributing to the achievement of 
positive risk management, and outcomes 
to support the Groups consequence 
management framework. The Board 
places a high importance on accountability, 
with remuneration consequences being 
applied when risk and conduct standards 
are not met. 
During the 2019 financial year, a number 
of changes were implemented in order 
to strengthen the link between risk 
management and remuneration outcomes, 
including:
 An Exceptionally Managed category 
being added to the risk assessment 
scale, to ensure the risk assessment 
process promotes and recognises 
effective risk behaviours, supporting 
positive cultural change.
 Introduction of concurrent Board 
Committee meetings during which 
material financial and non-financial 
risks relevant to executive performance 
and remuneration are collectively 
considered across all Committees.
 Updated remuneration mix for the 
Group Chief Risk Officer to now differ 
from other Group Executives and 
further support his independent status 
from the Groups business activities 
The vote on this Item is advisory only 
and does not bind the Directors or 
theCompany. 
The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote in favour of this Item.
ITEM 4
Grant of Securities to Matt Comyn 
ASX Listing Rule 10.14 requires shareholder 
approval for the acquisition of securities 
by a director under an employee incentive 
scheme. Securities include shares and 
rights to acquire shares. While it is currently 
intended that shares will be acquired 
on market as opposed to issuing new 
shares to satisfy any award that vests, 
shareholder approval is being sought, 
both for good governance and to preserve 
flexibility in case, for any reason, it is 
ultimately considered in the Companys 
best interests to issue shares rather than 
source them on market. 
Approval is sought to grant Matt Comyn, 
the Companys Managing Director and 
CEO, rights under the Companys EEP 
as his long-term variable remuneration 
(LTVR) award. LTVR forms part of the 
Companys remuneration strategy 
for the CEO, with market competitive 
remuneration at risk and in alignment with 
shareholder interests. 
It is proposed that a maximum of 47,957 
rights will be granted to Matt Comyn. 
The rights entitle Matt Comyn to receive 
shares, or a cash equivalent payment, 
as determined by the Board, subject to 
vesting conditions, including satisfaction  
of the performance hurdles set out  
below over the period from 1 July 2019 to 
30 June 2023 (the Performance Period). 
The LTVR award aims to focus efforts on 
achieving superior performance for the 
Companys key stakeholder groups, being 
its customers, community, employees and 
shareholders. Participants in the LTVR 
award for the financial year ending 30 
June 2020 comprise Matt Comyn and the 
Companys Group Executives. The CEO 
ASB will also participate in the LTVR award 
for the financial year ending 30 June 2020 
with performance measures relevant to 
the ASB business. Details will be provided 
in the 2020 Annual Report. No other 
Directors are entitled to participate in the 
LTVR award. 
Further details about the rights to be 
offered to Matt Comyn, and the applicable 
performance measures for the LTVR 
award, are set out below.
LTVR award
Matt Comyns 2020 financial year LTVR 
award will be determined according to 
three performance measures:
1. Total Shareholder Returns: 75% of the 
award, a maximum number of 35,969 
rights, will be subject to a performance 
measure that ranks the Companys 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
relative to a peer group comprising 
the 20 largest companies by market 
capitalisation listed on the ASX on 1 July 
2019, excluding resources companies 
and CBA. 
 
The TSR peer group comprises Amcor 
Limited, Aristocrat Leisure Limited, ASX 
Limited, Australia and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited, Brambles 
Limited, Coles Group Limited, CSL 
Limited, Goodman Group, Insurance 
Australia Group Limited, Macquarie 
Group Limited, National Australia 
Bank Limited, QBE Insurance Group 
Limited, Scentre Group, Suncorp 
Group Limited, Sydney Airport, Telstra 
Corporation Limited, Transurban Group, 
Wesfarmers Limited, Westpac Banking 
Corporation, and Woolworths Group 
Limited.
2. Trust and Reputation: 12.5% of the 
award, a maximum number of 5,994 
rights, will be measured against 
the RepTrak Pulse Score Survey 
conducted by the Reputation Institute, 
which uses four equally weighted 
questions to test the trust, respect 
and admiration a respondent has for 
a particular company. The Companys 
score over the Performance Period is 
compared with, and ranked against, 
the performance over the same period 
of a peer group of 16 of the largest 
consumer-facing companies listed 
on the ASX by market capitalisation.

Other Executives include Michael Venter (Chief Operating Officer Wealth Management) and all Acting Group Executives.

Explanatory 
Memorandum
For personal use only
The peer group excludes resource 
companies, companies that are 
not familiar to the general public, 
companies that do not operate 
nationally, and CBA. A positive TSR 
gateway must be achieved before 
any rights subject to this performance 
measure can vest to ensure that no 
vesting occurs unless the change  
in shareholder value over the period 
ispositive.
 
The peer group comprises AGL Energy 
Limited, Australia and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited, Coles Group 
Limited, Crown Resorts Limited, 
Insurance Australia Group Limited, 
Macquarie Group Limited, Medibank 
Private Limited, National Australia Bank 
Limited, Qantas Airways Limited, QBE 
Insurance Group Limited, Stockland 
Corporation Ltd, Suncorp Group 
Limited, Telstra Corporation Limited, 
Wesfarmers Limited, Westpac Banking 
Corporation, and Woolworths Group 
Limited.
3. Employee Engagement: 12.5% of the 
award, a maximum number of 5,994 
rights, will be measured against an 
Employee Engagement performance 
measure. Employees are invited to 
participate in an externally conducted 
survey. Employee Engagement is 
based on the proportion of employees 
responding that they strongly 
agree or agree with four questions 
relating to satisfaction, commitment, 
advocacy and pride (each of which 
is equally weighted). Employee 
Engagement will be measured based 
on the improvement of the Companys 
Employee Engagement outcomes 
over the Performance Period. The 
surveys will be conducted by an 
independent provider who will facilitate 
and collate the results. A positive TSR 
gateway must be achieved before 
any rights subject to this performance 
measure can vest to ensure that no 
vesting occurs unless the change in 
shareholder value over the period is 
positive.
In addition, the LTVR award will be subject to a risk and reputation review by the Board 
before any vesting occurs. This ensures that the outcomes that would otherwise be 
delivered based on performance against the performance measures appropriately 
considers the Banks risk and reputation outcomes.
The number of rights that vest for each performance hurdle will be determined as set  
out below:

For personal use only
The Board may change the peer group 
companies listed above, for example, if  
one of the peer group companies 
ceases to be listed on the ASX during the 
performance period. The next largest ASX 
listed companies by market capitalisation 
at the being of the performance period 
provides the reserve bench. 
How many rights will be granted  
to Matt Comyn?
A maximum of 47,957 rights will be granted 
to Matt Comyn. This number has been 
determined by dividing his maximum 
LTVR opportunity for each tranche by the 
volume weighted average price (VWAP) 
of the Companys ordinary shares over the 
five trading days up to 1 July 2019 (being 
$82.57)). 
If the Company makes a bonus issue or 
rights issue or undertakes a corporate 
action or capital reconstruction, the Board 
may adjust the number or value of the 
rights granted to Matt Comyn to ensure 
no material advantage or disadvantage 
occurs, subject to any ASX Listing Rule 
requirements. Any such adjustments will 
be explained in the Companys Annual 
Report issued following the adjustment. 
Each of the LTVR performance measures 
will be tested following the end of the 
Performance Period (i.e. after year ending 
30 June 2023). The total number of rights 
(if any) that vest will be the aggregate of the 
rights that vest against each performance 
measure, subject to the discretion retained 
by the Board. 
The total award is subject to a risk and 
reputation review. The Board retains 
discretion to determine the amount and 
form of any award that may vest (if any). 
The Board has discretion to determine 
that some or all of the award will lapse in 
certain circumstances, including where,  
in the opinion of the Board:
 
the vesting of rights is not justified or 
supportable having regard to Matt 
Comyns performance and/or conduct 
or the performance of the Company  
as a whole; or
 
the vesting of rights will impact on the 
financial soundness of the Company  
or one of its subsidiaries; or
 
the Company is required or entitled to 
reclaim remuneration or reduce Matt 
Comyns remuneration outcome under 
law, regulation or Company policy; or
 
a significant unexpected or unintended 
consequence or outcome has occurred 
which impacts the Company.
When will the rights be granted?
The rights will be granted to Matt Comyn 
following the 2019 AGM, and in any event 
no later than 12 months after the AGM. 
Is Matt Comyn required to pay for 
therights?
The rights will be granted to Matt Comyn  
at no cost. Matt Comyn will not be 
provided with any loans in relation to his 
acquisition of securities under the EEP.
Is Matt Comyn entitled to dividends?
Prior to vesting, rights do not carry any 
voting or dividend (or equivalent payment) 
rights. Any shares allocated to Matt Comyn 
on vesting of the rights will carry the same 
rights (including with respect to voting and 
dividends) as other ordinary shares in  
the Company. This means that Matt Comyn 
will only receive dividends that are paid 
from the time any rights vest as shares. 
Treatment of shares and rights  
if Matt Comyn leaves the Company
In general, if Matt Comyn ceases 
employment before the rights vest, unless 
the Board determines otherwise, his 
unvested rights will remain on foot and the 
vesting conditions will be tested in  
the ordinary course following the end of 
the Performance Period . In the case  
of termination of employment for cause, 
unless the Board determines otherwise, 
the unvested rights will lapse.
Any rights granted under this award that 
do not vest when tested following the end 
of the Performance Period will lapse.
Participation under previous approvals
At the 2018 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders approved the granting to 
Matt Comyn of rights under the EEP. Matt 
Comyn was subsequently granted 54,364 
rights which are subject to the terms of the 
2019 financial year LTVR award. No price  
is or was payable for the acquisition of 
those rights. No other rights have been 
granted to a Director under the EEP or any 
other employee incentive scheme, since 
the 2018 Annual General Meeting. 
If approval is given under ASX Listing Rule 
10.14, approval is not required under ASX 
Listing Rule 7.1.
The Board (with Matt Comyn abstaining) 
recommends that shareholders vote  
in favour of this Item.
ITEM 5
Adoption of a new Constitution
The Companys current Constitution 
was last amended at the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting. It is proposed to adopt 
a new Constitution as there have been a 
number of developments in law, corporate 
governance principles and general 
corporate and commercial practice for 
ASX listed companies since that time.
The Board recommends the adoption of 
a new Constitution which reflects current 
market practice and terminology. Many of 
the proposed changes are administrative 
or relatively minor in nature. The material 
differences between the current 
Constitution and the new Constitution 
areoutlined below.
Share capital and variation of 
classrights
The preference share provisions in rule 
2.2 of the new Constitution are less 
prescriptive than the equivalent provisions 
under the current Constitution, conferring 
greater flexibility regarding the terms of 
any preference shares issued in the future. 
Proposed rule 2.5(b) of the new 
Constitution sets out the rules relating 
to separate class meetings such that 
a quorum is at least 2 persons holding 
or representing at least one third of the 
issued shares of the class or, if there is one 
holder of shares in a class, that person. 
Any holder of shares of the class present, 
or the chair of the meeting, may demand 
a poll. 
Calls, forfeiture, indemnities, 
lienandsurrender
Currently, the Company has a default fixed 
interest rate of 15% p.a. (or such other 
rate as the Directors may determine) in 
respect of amounts which may be owed 
by shareholders. Under rule 3.9 of the 
new Constitution, this default fixed rate 
would be replaced by a floating interest 
rate based on the penalty interest rate 
set under legislation (or if the Board has 
fixed a rate, that rate). Proposed rules 3.4, 
3.5 and 3.6 also clarify the ability of the 
Board to exempt shares from forfeiture, 
lien and the members indemnity under 
the Constitution (should circumstances 
warrant it).

Explanatory 
Memorandum
For personal use only
Dividends 
The Companys current Constitution 
has separate provisions for interim and 
final dividends and adopts a range of 
terminology to describe how the Company 
pays dividends. Rule 4.1 of the new 
Constitution harmonises these provisions 
and adopts the generic term dividend to 
avoid any potential technical distinctions 
interminology.
Proposed rule 4.1 also introduces scope 
for the Company to reinvest unclaimed 
dividends, for the benefit of the relevant 
shareholder, into shares in the Company 
after a period of time has elapsed. The 
existing equivalent rule in the Companys 
current Constitution provides that 
unclaimed money can be used for the 
benefit of the Company until such time as 
it is claimed or disposed of in accordance 
with the law.
Transfer and transmission of shares
The Companys current constitutional 
provisions regarding unmarketable parcels 
of shares impose time limitations which are 
not required under the ASX Listing Rules. 
These restrictions are removed in the new 
Constitution which more closely reflects 
the requirements of the ASX Listing Rules. 
New rule 5.4 clarifies that the Board may, 
in certain circumstances, revoke a notice 
given in relation to an unmarketableparcel.
General meetings
The new Constitution incorporates a 
number of changes to assist with the 
orderly conduct of general meetings of 
theCompany.
Rule 6.6 of the new Constitution expressly 
confirms the Chairmans power to not 
put certain resolutions to the meeting, 
notwithstanding they may have been listed 
in the notice of meeting. 
New rule 6.7 provides that a matter will be 
decided on a poll without first being put  
to the meeting on a show of hands where 
the matter is set out in the notice of 
meeting or any other circumstance where 
the Chairman determines it appropriate. 
Directors
The Companys current Constitution 
requires one third of the Board to stand 
for election at each AGM. The new 
Constitution will remove this rule to bring 
the Companys Constitution in line with 
the ASX Listing Rules, which require 
an election of Directors each year and 
that a Director must not hold office 
(without re-election) past the third annual 
general meeting following the Directors 
appointment or three years, whichever 
islonger.
The rules in the new Constitution 
relating to Directors remuneration 
are broadly in line with the rules in the 
current Constitution. Rule 7.3 of the new 
Constitution clarifies that in calculating 
the maximum fees payable to Directors, 
superannuation contributions made to 
comply with superannuation guarantee 
legislation are included in the aggregate 
fee cap.
The current Constitution provides that 
the quorum for a Directors meeting is 
one half of the total number of Directors 
for the time being in office (rounded 
upwards if not a whole number), or three, 
whichever is greater. The new Constitution 
provides that unless the Board decides 
differently, the quorum is one half of the 
total number of Directors for the time 
being in office who are not excluded 
(rounded upwards if not a whole number) 
or three, whichever is greater. A Director 
will be excluded where (i) they are on a 
leave of absence approved by the Board, 
(ii) they have notified the Chairman or the 
Group Company Secretary they may be 
uncontactable for a certain period of time 
and the Board meeting is held during that 
period, (iii) they are incapacitated (e.g. 
due to ill health), (iv) they have disqualified 
themselves from considering the relevant 
item(s) of business at a Board meeting, or 
(v) they would be prohibited under the Act 
or other laws or regulations from voting on 
the relevant item(s) of business.
Directors can pass written resolutions 
of the Board where (i) all Directors (other 
than those excluded as outlined below) 
sign or consent to the resolution, and 
(ii) the Directors who sign or consent to 
the resolution would have constituted a 
quorum at the meeting.
Directors will be excluded where (i) they 
are on a leave of absence approved by the 
Board, (ii) they have notified the Chairman 
or the Group Company Secretary they 
may be uncontactable during the period 
the resolution is being considered, (iii) they 
are incapacitated (e.g. due to ill health), 
(iv) they have disqualified themselves 
from considering the resolution or (v) they 
would be prohibited under the Act or other 
laws or regulations from voting on the 
resolution. All Directors are expected to 
attend all Board meetings and participate 
in Board decisions.
Notices
The Companys existing rules regarding 
giving notice to shareholders provide that, 
aside from the notice of meeting, notice 
will be served on the day that it would 
arrive in the ordinary course of the post. 
Rule 13.4 of the new Constitution adopts 
a standard ASX listed company approach 
to members notices and simplifies 
administration by providing that a notice 
from the Company properly addressed 
and posted, is taken to be served at 
10.00am Sydney time on the day after 
thedate it is posted. 
General Updates
Rules which were outdated or restated 
Act or ASX Listing Rule requirements have 
been removed to simplify the document 
and minimise the need for updates in 
the event of any legislative or regulatory 
change. The provisions of the Constitution 
have been amended to reflect changes 
in terminology now contained in the Act, 
the ASX Listing Rules and ASX Settlement 
Operating Rules. 
The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote in favour of this Item.

LODGEMENT OF A VOTING/PROXY FORM
HOW TO COMPLETE THIS VOTING/PROXY FORM
YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS
This is your name and address as it appears on the Companys share register. If 
this information is incorrect, please make the correction on this form. Shareholders 
sponsored by a broker should advise their broker of any changes. Please note: 
you cannot change ownership of your shares using this form.
METHOD A  VOTE DIRECTLY
If you mark the box in METHOD A, you are indicating that you wish to vote directly. 
Please mark either For, Against or Abstain for an Item for your vote to be 
counted on that Item. If you vote on at least one Item but leave other Item(s) blank, 
the vote on the Item(s) marked will be valid but no vote will be counted or treated as 
being cast for the Item(s) left blank. If you mark more than one box on an Item, your 
vote on the Item will be invalid. If no voting instructions are given on all of the Items 
then the Chairman of the Meeting will be deemed to be your appointed proxy.
If you mark the boxes in both METHOD A and METHOD B then METHOD B is 
deemed to be the chosen method. The person named will be your proxy, or if no 
person is named, the Chairman of the Meeting will be your appointed proxy.
If you have lodged a direct vote, and then attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting, your direct vote will be cancelled. Attending the Annual General Meeting 
only will not invalidate your direct vote.
The Chairmans decision as to whether a direct vote is valid is conclusive.
METHOD B  APPOINT A PROXY
If you wish to appoint the Chairman of the Meeting as your proxy, mark the box 
in METHOD B. If you wish to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the 
Meeting as your proxy, please write the name of that person or body corporate in 
the box provided. If you leave this section blank, or your named proxy does not 
attend the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman of the Meeting will be your 
proxy. If your named proxy attends the Annual General Meeting but does not vote 
on a poll on an Item in accordance with your directions, the Chairman of the 
Meeting will become your proxy in respect of that Item. A proxy need not be a 
shareholder of the Company. A proxy may be an individual or a body corporate.
VOTES ON ITEMS OF BUSINESS  PROXY APPOINTMENT
You should direct your proxy how to vote by placing a mark in one of the boxes 
opposite each Item of Business. All your shares will be voted in accordance with 
such a direction, unless you indicate only a portion of voting rights are to be voted 
on any Item by inserting the percentage or number of shares you wish to vote in 
the appropriate box or boxes. If you do not mark any of the boxes on the Items of 
Business, your proxy may vote, or abstain from voting, as he or she chooses. If 
you mark more than one box on an Item, your vote on that Item will be invalid.
APPOINTMENT OF A SECOND PROXY
If you are a shareholder entitled to cast two or more votes, you are entitled to 
appoint up to two persons as proxies to attend the Annual General Meeting and 
vote on a poll. If you wish to appoint a second proxy, an additional Voting/Proxy 
Form may be obtained by telephoning the Companys share registry or you may 
copy this form. 
To appoint a second proxy you must:
(a) on each of the first Voting/Proxy Form and the second Voting/Proxy Form, 
state the percentage of your voting rights or number of shares applicable to 
that form. If the appointments do not specify the percentage or number of 
votes that each proxy may exercise, each proxy may exercise half your votes. 
Fractions of votes will be disregarded; and
(b) return both forms together.
SIGNING INSTRUCTIONS
You must sign this form as follows in the spaces provided:
Individual: where the holding is in one name, the holder must sign.

ASX announcement 
ISSUE OF U.S.$2.5 BILLION WORTH OF 
SUBORDINATED NOTES 
Notice under section 708A(12H)(e) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) 
Thursday, 12 September 2019: Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is pleased to confirm that today it issued 
U.S.$2.5 billion worth of subordinated notes. The U.S.$1.25 billion 3.610 percent subordinated notes due 2034 (2034 
Subordinated Notes) and the U.S.$1.25 billion 3.743 percent subordinated notes due 2039 (2039 Subordinated 
Notes, and together with the 2034 Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Notes) were issued pursuant to CBAs U.S. 
$50,000,000,000 Senior and Subordinated Medium Term Notes Program (U.S. MTN Program). Terms used but not 
defined in this announcement are defined in the offering circular for the issue of the Subordinated Notes under U.S. 
MTN Program dated 23 August 2019 (Offering Circular). 
The Subordinated Notes potentially exchange into fully paid ordinary shares of CBA (Ordinary Shares) if a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs. 
This notice is a cleansing notice prepared for the purposes of section 708A(12H)(e) of the Corporations Act 2001 
(Cth) (Corporations Act) (as inserted by ASIC Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71). 
CBA has elected to give this notice to enable Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange to be sold without disclosure 
under Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act. This notice includes all the information investors and their professional 
advisers would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of: 
 
in Schedule 1A, the rights and liabilities attaching to the 2034 Subordinated Notes that is based on the 
description in the Offering Circular, as supplemented by the pricing supplement for the 2034 Subordinated 
Notes dated 5 September 2019 (2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement);  
 
in Schedule 1B, the rights and liabilities attaching to the 2039 Subordinated Notes that is based on the 
description in the Offering Circular, as supplemented by the pricing supplement for the 2039 Subordinated 
Notes dated 5 September 2019 (2039 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, and together with the 
2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, Pricing Supplement); and  
 
in Schedule 2, the rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares, 
in each case only to the extent to which it is reasonable for investors and their professional advisers to expect to find 
the information in this notice. 
CBA confirms that: 
(a) 
the Subordinated Notes were issued without disclosure to investors under Part 6D.2 of the Corporations Act; 
(b) 
the information in this notice remains current as at todays date; 
(c) 
this notice (including the schedules) complies with section 708A of the Corporations Act, as modified by ASIC 
Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71; and

Effect of the Subordinated Notes offer on CBA 
The issue of Subordinated Notes by CBA will not have a material impact on CBAs financial position. If a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event occurs and CBA issues Ordinary Shares, the impact of Exchange on CBA would be to increase CBAs 
shareholders equity. The number of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange is limited to the Maximum Exchange 
Number. The Maximum Exchange Number is 94.82 Ordinary Shares per Subordinated Note (with a nominal value of 
A$1,475.20), based on the Issue Date VWAP of A$77.79 per Ordinary Share.  
Additional information 
CBA is a disclosing entity for the purposes of the Corporations Act and, as a result, is subject to regular reporting and 
disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act and the ASX Listing Rules. In addition, CBA must notify ASX 
immediately (subject to certain exceptions) if it becomes aware of information about CBA that a reasonable person 
would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of its securities including Ordinary Shares. 
Copies of documents lodged with ASIC can be obtained from, or inspected at, an ASIC office. They can also be 
obtained from www.asx.com.au together with CBAs other ASX announcements.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED NOTES 
The information included in the following sections of this document is based on material in the Offering Circular and the 2034 
Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement. 
The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations and claims in respect of Subordinated Notes will 
rank in our Winding-Up after the claims of all Senior Ranking Obligations, pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking 
Securities and ahead of claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities, as further defined and described below under How the 
Subordinated Notes rank against other debt.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs prior to the maturity date or earlier Subordinated Note Redemption, we must Exchange all 
or some of the Subordinated Notes or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case 
may be and in an amount as determined as described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event below) for Ordinary Shares. A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing 
that it believes (i) an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA 
Group, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable or (ii) a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable. 
If, for any reason, an Exchange fails to take effect and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in 
respect of such Exchange within five Business Days after the occurrence of the applicable Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the 
rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest and 
to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes or the percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down. See Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event for more information. 
If the amount of our Relevant Tier 1 Securities is not sufficient to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable, some or all 
of our Relevant Tier 2 Securities, including the Subordinated Notes, will be subject to Exchange or Write Down. See  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event below.  
A Subordinated Note Redemption may, subject to the terms described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated 
Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances, occur at our option, in whole but not in 
part, following the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events.  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued only in fully registered form in denominations of US$200,000 and integral multiples of 
US$1,000 in excess thereof (the Specified Denomination). 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Fiscal Agency Agreement and its associated 
documents, including the Subordinated Notes and the 2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, contain the full legal text 
of the matters described in this section entitled Description of the Subordinated Notes. This section is a summary only and 
does not describe every aspect of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. For example, in this section and the 
2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, we use terms that have been given special meaning in the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement, but we describe the meaning of only the more important of those terms.  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us and the subordination, 
Exchange, Write Down and substitution provisions of the Subordinated Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the law applying in New South Wales, Australia.  
For personal use only

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Copies of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the form of Subordinated Note are available for inspection during normal business 
hours at the office of the Fiscal Agent.  
The Fiscal Agent performs administrative duties for us such as sending interest payments and notices to holders. See  Our 
relationship with the Fiscal Agent below for more information about the Fiscal Agent.  
We may issue other debt securities  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes do not limit our ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other 
securities. Also, we are not subject to financial covenants or similar restrictions by the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt 
Loss absorption does not apply to our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
The requirement for a conversion or write down on account of our non-viability does not apply to an amount of our 
subordinated debt that was issued prior to January 1, 2013. Accordingly, holders of Subordinated Notes are likely to be in a 
worse position in the event we become non-viable than holders of our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
because that subordinated debt generally does not require that it be exchanged or written down upon the occurrence of a Non-
Viability Trigger Event.  
Status of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will not be secured by any of our property or assets. Thus, by owning a Subordinated Note, a holder of 
a Subordinated Noted is an unsecured creditor. The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations 
and will rank pari passu with Equal Ranking Securities.  
The liabilities which are preferred by law to the claim of a holder in respect of the Subordinated Notes are substantial. The terms 
and conditions of the Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of such liabilities which we may incur or assume from time to 
time. 
Each holder should be aware that, if we are in a Winding-Up, it is possible that a Non-Viability Trigger Event will have already 
occurred, following which the holders Subordinated Notes may be, or may have already been, Exchanged for Ordinary Shares or 
Written Down. See  How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt and  Default, remedies and waiver of default 
below for additional information on how subordination limits the ability of holders of Subordinated Notes to receive payment or 
pursue other rights if we default or have certain other financial difficulties.  
Claims in respect of Subordinated Notes rank in our Winding-Up: 
 
after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims preferred by applicable laws;  
 
pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking Securities; and  
 
ahead of all claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims referred to in Sections 563AA and 563A of 
the Corporations Act.  
The applicable laws referred to above include (but are not limited to) Sections 13A and 16 of the Australian Banking Act and 
Section 86 of the Reserve Bank Act. These provisions provide that, in the event that we becomes unable to meet our obligations 
or suspend payment, our assets in Australia are to be available to meet our liabilities to, among others, APRA, the RBA and 
holders of protected accounts held in Australia, in priority to all other liabilities, including the Subordinated Notes.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. The Subordinated Notes do not constitute 
deposit liabilities or protected accounts for us in Australia for the purposes of the Australian Banking Act and are not insured or 
guaranteed by the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any government, governmental agency or 
compensation scheme of the United States, Australia or any other jurisdiction or by any other party.   
In our Winding-Up, payments on each Subordinated Note are subject to: (i) all holders of Senior Ranking Obligations being paid 
in full before any payment is made to holders of Subordinated Notes; and (ii) holders of Subordinated Notes and holders of 
Equal Ranking Securities being paid on a pro-rata basis.  
We expect that from time to time we will incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that will constitute Senior Ranking 
Obligations. The Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of our obligations that can rank ahead of the Subordinated Notes 
that we may incur or assume in the future. 
Equal Ranking Securities means any instrument that ranks in our Winding-Up as the most junior claim in our Winding-Up 
ranking senior to Junior Ranking Securities, and includes: 
 
if on issue at the commencement of our Winding-Up, the JPY20,000,000,000 Perpetual Subordinated Callable 
Fixed/Floating Rate Reverse Dual Currency Securities issued by us in 1999; and 
 
any other instruments, present and future, issued after January 1, 2013 as instruments constituting Tier 2 Capital. 
Junior Ranking Securities means:  
 
any instrument, present and future, issued by us which qualifies as Tier 1 Capital (or, in the case of any instrument 
issued prior to January 1, 2013), was treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in accordance with the prudential standards 
which applied prior to January 1, 2013, irrespective of whether or not such instrument is treated as constituting Tier 1 
Capital in accordance with any transitional arrangements provided by APRA or which rank or are expressed to rank 
equally with such securities in our Winding-Up; and  
 
all of our Ordinary Shares. 
Senior Ranking Obligations means all our present and future deposits and other liabilities, securities and other obligations 
which would be entitled to be admitted in our Winding-Up (and including, but not limited to, obligations in respect of 
instruments issued before January 1, 2013 as Tier 2 Capital) other than Equal Ranking Securities and Junior Ranking Securities.  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of us, any holder of a Subordinated Note or any person claiming 
through us or a holder of a Subordinated Note has any right of set-off in respect of any amounts owed by one person to the 
other person. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement, each holder irrevocably acknowledges and 
agrees that: 
 
the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes are a debt subordination for the purposes of Section 563C of 
the Australian Corporations Act;  
 
the debt subordination is not affected by our act or omission, or any act or omission of any holder of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, which might otherwise affect holders of Subordinated Notes at law or in equity; 
 
it must not exercise its voting rights as an unsecured creditor in our Winding-Up or administration in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes to defeat the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes; and 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
12 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
it must pay or deliver to the liquidator any amount or asset received on account of its claim in the Winding-Up in 
excess of its entitlement under the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes. 
For the avoidance of doubt, but subject as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence 
of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot occur, if a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred, 
holders of Subordinated Notes will rank in our Winding-Up as holders of the number of Ordinary Shares to which they became 
entitled as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
Form of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued in global  i.e., book-entry  form represented by a global security registered in the 
name of a depositary, which will be the holder of all the Subordinated Notes represented by the global security.  
Subordinated Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (Securities Act) will be represented by one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Rule 144A Global Note), 
registered in the name of a nominee of The Depositary Trust Company (DTC). Subordinated Notes sold outside of the United 
States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be represented by 
one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Regulation S Global Note and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the 
Global Notes) registered in the name of a nominee of DTC or a common depositary for DTC (the Depositary).  
Those who own beneficial interests in a Global Note will do so through participants in the Depositarys securities clearance 
system, and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the Depositary and its 
participants.  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  
Non-Viability Trigger Event 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes: 
 
an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA Group, 
is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable; or 
 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-
viable. 
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital instruments which must be Exchanged, Written Down, converted or written 
down (as applicable). 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, we must Exchange in accordance with Exchange and No further rights if Exchange 
cannot occur below such number of Subordinated Notes (or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) as is equal (taking into account any conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities 
as defined below) to the aggregate face value of capital instruments which APRA has notified us must be exchanged, converted 
or written down (or, if APRA has not so notified us, such number or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note as is necessary to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable). If a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable, we must Exchange all Subordinated Notes.

In determining the number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, which must be Exchanged in accordance with this section, we will: 
 
first, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 1 Securities whose terms require or permit, 
or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange of the 
Subordinated Notes; 
 
secondly, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or 
permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange 
of the Subordinated Notes; and  
 
thirdly, if exchange, conversion or write down of those securities is not sufficient, Exchange (in the case of the 
Subordinated Notes) or exchange, convert or write down (in the case of any other Relevant Tier 2 Securities) on a pro-
rata basis or in a manner that is otherwise, in our opinion, fair and reasonable, the Subordinated Notes and any other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be 
exchanged, converted or written down in that manner (subject to such adjustments as we may determine to take into 
account the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares and any Subordinated Notes or other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities remaining on issue),  
but such determination will not impede the immediate Exchange of the relevant number of Subordinated Notes or percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be).  
Relevant Security means a Relevant Tier 1 Security and a Relevant Tier 2 Security. 
Relevant Tier 1 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 1 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
Relevant Tier 2 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 2 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, then: 
 
the relevant number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, must be Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event in accordance with 
Exchange and Exchange Mechanics below and the Exchange will be irrevocable; 
 
we must give notice as soon as practicable that Exchange has occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the 
holders of Subordinated Notes; 
 
the notice must specify the date on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred; and 
 
the notice must specify the details of the Exchange process, including any details which were taken into account in 
relation to the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, and the impact on any 
Subordinated Notes remaining on issue. 
Failure to undertake any of the steps in the paragraph above does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise impede Exchange or 
Write Down, respectively. 
For the purposes of the foregoing, where the specified currency of the face value of Relevant Tier 1 Securities, Relevant Tier 2 
Securities and/or Subordinated Notes (as applicable) is not Australian Dollars, we may treat them as if converted into Australian 
Dollars using the Exchange Date Cross Rate.

Exchange 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be Exchanged at the option of a holder thereof. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred and all or some of the Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are required to be Exchanged in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then: 
 
Exchange of the relevant Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each 
Subordinated Note will occur in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event and Exchange Mechanics 
immediately upon the date of occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event; and 
 
the entry of the corresponding Subordinated Note in each relevant holding of a holder of Subordinated Notes in the 
register of the Depositary will constitute an entitlement of that holder of Subordinated Notes (or, where the provisions 
described under Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, of the nominee) to the relevant number of 
Ordinary Shares (and, if applicable, also to any remaining balance of the Subordinated Notes or remaining percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note), and we will recognize the holder of Subordinated 
Notes (or, where Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, the nominee) as having been issued the 
relevant Ordinary Shares for all purposes, 
in each case without the need for any further act or step by us, the holder of the Subordinated Note or any other person (and 
we will, as soon as possible thereafter and without delay on our part, take any appropriate procedural steps to record such 
Exchange, including to procure the updating of the register of the Depositary and the Ordinary Share register and seek quotation 
of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange). 
In relation to an Exchange, we shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary of the percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note that has been Exchanged and instruct the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary to reflect this 
Exchange in the relevant Global Note or other certificate representing the Subordinated Notes so that the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of such Subordinated Note is reduced by the relevant percentage. In the case of an Exchange of only part of a 
Subordinated Note, upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Note, we will issue a new Subordinated Note in the 
name of the holder with a reduced Outstanding Principal Amount reflecting the Exchange.  
For the avoidance of doubt: 
 
nothing in the Subordinated Notes will allow a payment to be made to a holder of Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; 
and 
 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption issued as 
described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated 
Notes under certain circumstances. 
Exchange means the exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes or a percentage of each Subordinated Note for Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and Exchanged has a corresponding meaning. 
No further rights if Exchange cannot occur 
If for any reason, Exchange of any Subordinated Note or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated 
Note required to be Exchanged described under Non-Viability Trigger Event fails to take effect as described in Exchange 
and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business

Days after the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated 
Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest, and the right to receive Ordinary Shares) in 
relation to such Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately and irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the 
occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event (Written Down). We must give notice as soon as practicable that Write Down has 
occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes, and the notice must specify the date on 
which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred.  
Appointment of Appointed Person 
Each holder of a Subordinated Note, on behalf of itself and (in the case of any Global Note) any person owning an indirect 
interest in such Subordinated Note, irrevocably: 
 
appoints us and our duly authorized officers and any liquidator, administrator, statutory manager or other similar 
official of CBA (each an Appointed Person) severally to be the attorney of the holder and the agents of the holder, 
with the power in the name and on behalf of the holder to: 
 
do all such acts and things (including, without limitation signing all documents, instruments or transfers or 
instructing CHESS) as may, in the opinion of the Appointed Person, be necessary or desirable to be done in 
order to give effect to, record or perfect an Exchange or Write Down (as applicable); 
 
do all other things which an Appointed Person reasonably believes to be necessary or desirable to give effect 
to the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
appoint in turn its own agent or delegate; and 
 
authorizes and directs us and/or the Fiscal Agent to make such entries in the register, including amendments and 
additions to the register, which we and/or the Fiscal Agent may consider necessary or desirable to record an Exchange 
or Write Down (as applicable). 
The power of attorney to be given by Subordinated Note holders in respect of the Subordinated Notes will be given for valuable 
consideration and to secure the performance by the Subordinated Note holder of the Subordinated Note holders obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes, will be irrevocable and will survive and not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity 
of the Subordinated Note holder (or, if such Subordinated Note holder is an entity, by its dissolution or termination). An 
Appointed Person will have no liability in respect of any acts duly performed in accordance with the power of attorney thereby 
given.

Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) required to be Exchanged. The Exchange Number is, subject 
always to the Exchange Number being no greater than the Maximum Exchange Number, calculated according to the

VWAP (expressed in Australian dollars and cents) means the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of 
Ordinary Shares traded on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period, subject to any adjustments made as described under 
 Adjustments to VWAP generally and  Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction, but the trades taken 
into account in determining such daily volume weighted average prices will exclude special crossings, crossings prior to 
the commencement of normal trading or during the closing phase or after hours adjustment phase, overnight

The rights of each holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of interest) in relation to each Subordinated Note that is 
being Exchanged (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note that is being Exchanged) will 
be immediately and irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) and we will apply that amount by way of 
payment for the subscription for the Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued under as described under the paragraph above. 
Each holder of Subordinated Notes is taken to have irrevocably directed that any amount payable under this section is to be 
applied as provided for in this section and no holder of Subordinated Notes has any right to payment in any other way. 
If the total number of additional Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued in respect of the aggregate holding of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes includes a fraction of an Ordinary Share, that fraction of an Ordinary Share will be disregarded. 
Subject to the conditions described in Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, where Subordinated Notes are Exchanged, we will allot 
and issue the Ordinary Shares to the holder of Subordinated Notes on the basis that the name and address set out in the register 
of holders (or, if not set out in the register, otherwise held by the Depositary) are the name and address for entry into any 
register of title and delivery of any certificate or holding statement in respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange. 
Adjustments to VWAP generally 
For the purposes of calculating the VWAP under Exchange above:  
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the relevant VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted on ASX as 
cum dividend or cum any other distribution or entitlement and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary 
Shares after that date and those Ordinary Shares will no longer carry that dividend or any other distribution or 
entitlement, then the VWAP on the Business Days on which those Ordinary Shares have been quoted cum dividend or 
cum any other distribution or entitlement will be reduced by an amount (Cum Value) equal to:  
 
in the case of a cash dividend or other distribution, the amount of that dividend or other distribution;  
 
in the case of any other entitlement that is not a dividend or other distribution under the bullet above which 
is traded on ASX on any of those Business Days, the volume weighted average price of all such entitlements 
sold on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period on the Business Days on which those entitlements were traded 
(excluding trades of the kind that would be excluded in determining VWAP under the definition of that 
term); or 
 
in the case of any other entitlement which is not traded on ASX during the VWAP Period, the value of the 
entitlement as reasonably determined by our Board; and 
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted as ex dividend or 
ex any other distribution or entitlement, and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares which would 
be entitled to receive the relevant dividend, distribution or entitlement, the VWAP on the Business Days on which 
those Ordinary Shares have been quoted ex dividend or ex any other distribution or entitlement will be increased by 
the Cum Value.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction 
Where, during the relevant VWAP Period, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because the Ordinary 
Shares are reconstructed, consolidated, divided or reclassified (not involving any payment or other compensation to or by 
holders of Ordinary Shares) (Reclassification) into a lesser or greater number, the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period 
which falls before the date on which trading in Ordinary Shares is conducted on a post Reclassification basis will be adjusted by 
multiplying the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period by the following formula: 
A 
B 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately after the Reclassification. 
Any adjustment made by us in accordance with the paragraph above will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated 
Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement will be construed 
accordingly. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section allows a cash payment or other distribution to be made to or by a holder of 
Subordinated Notes as part of a Reclassification or as a result of a Reclassification. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP generally 
For the purposes of determining the Issue Date VWAP as described under Exchange, adjustments will be made in 
accordance with Adjustments to VWAP generally and Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction  during the 
VWAP Period for the Issue Date VWAP. On and from the issue date, adjustments to the Issue Date VWAP: 
 
may be made by us in accordance with the conditions described below under Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
bonus issues, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP in certain circumstances (inclusive); 
 
if so made, will correspondingly cause an adjustment to the Maximum Exchange Number; and  
 
if so made, will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be construed accordingly. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues 
Subject to the two paragraphs at the end of this section, if we make a pro-rata bonus issue of Ordinary Shares to holders of 
Ordinary Shares generally, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted immediately in accordance with the following formula: 
V = Vo x RD/(RD + RN) 
where: 
V means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately after the application of this formula; 
Vo means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately prior to the application of this formula; 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
19 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
RD means the number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately prior to the allotment of new Ordinary Shares 
pursuant to the bonus issue; and 
RN means the number of Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the bonus issue. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the paragraph above does not apply to Ordinary Shares issued as part of a bonus share plan, 
employee or executive share plan, executive option plan, share top up plan, share purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment 
plan. 
For the purposes of this section, an issue will be regarded as a bonus issue notwithstanding that we do not make offers to some 
or all holders of Ordinary Shares with registered addresses outside Australia (or to whom an offer is otherwise subject to foreign 
securities laws), provided that in so doing we are not in contravention of the ASX Listing Rules. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction 
If, at any time after the issue date, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because of a Reclassification into 
a lesser or greater number, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted by multiplying the Issue Date VWAP applicable on the Business 
Day immediately before the date of any such Reclassification by the following formula: 
A 
B 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately after the Reclassification. 
No adjustment to Issue Date VWAP in certain circumstances 
Despite the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP for capital reconstruction, no adjustment will be made to the Issue Date VWAP where any such adjustment (rounded if 
applicable) would be less than 1% of the Issue Date VWAP then in effect. 
Announcement of adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
We will notify any adjustment to the Issue Date VWAP under the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
generally, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues  and Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital 
reconstruction to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes within 10 Business Days of us 
determining the adjustment and the adjustment will be final and binding. 
Status and quotation of Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange will rank equally with all other fully paid Ordinary Shares provided that the 
rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange do not take effect until 5:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on the 
Exchange Date (or such other time required by APRA). 
We will use all reasonable endeavours to quote the Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange of the Subordinated Notes on ASX.

Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder 
1. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and: 
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes has notified us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of 
Exchange, which notice may be given at any time on or after the issue date and prior to the Exchange Date;  
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder; or  
 
we have not received (for any reason whether or not due to the fault of that holder of Subordinated Notes) any 
information required by it in accordance with the conditions of the Subordinated Notes so as to impede us issuing the 
Ordinary Shares to a holder of Subordinated Notes on the Exchange Date, 
then, subject to the provisions described in paragraph 2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below, on the Exchange Date, 
the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged are immediately and 
irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this Exchange where the 
holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section 
below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee may not be us or one of our 
Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares, the 
nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the relevant holder of 
Subordinated Notes (unless, because the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, the 
nominee is deemed to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, in which case such issue shall occur as soon as practicable 
after the nominee ceases to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder).  
Attributable Proceeds means the net proceeds of sale of Ordinary Shares attributable to the Subordinated Notes of 
the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes, or where the provisions described in paragraph 4 of this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder section below apply, the Depositary Participant, actually received after deducting any applicable brokerage, 
stamp duty and other taxes.  
Ineligible Subordinated Holder means a holder of Subordinated Notes who is prohibited or restricted by any 
applicable law or regulation in force in Australia (including but not limited to Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act, the

Australia and Part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) of Australia) from being offered, holding or 
acquiring Ordinary Shares provided that if the relevant prohibition or restriction only applies to the holder of 
Subordinated Notes in respect of some of its Subordinated Notes, it shall only be treated as an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder in respect of those Subordinated Notes and not in respect of the balance of its Subordinated Notes), and 
includes a Foreign Subordinated Holder. We will be entitled to treat a holder of Subordinated Notes as not being an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder unless the holder of Subordinated Notes has otherwise notified us after the issue date 
and prior to the Exchange Date. 
Foreign Subordinated Holder means: 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes whose address in the register is a place outside Australia; or 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes who we believe may not be a resident of Australia and we are not satisfied 
that the laws of the country in which we believe the holder of Subordinated Notes is resident permit the

offer of Ordinary Shares to, or holding or acquisition of Ordinary Shares by, the holder of Subordinated Notes 
(but we will not be bound to enquire into those laws), either unconditionally or after compliance with 
conditions which we, in our absolute discretion, regards as acceptable and not unduly onerous. 
2. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and the holder of Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or a nominee 
for a common depository for any one or more Depositary (such Depositary or nominee for a common depository 
acting in such capacity as is specified in the rules and regulations of the relevant Depositary or Depositaries) then, on 
the Exchange Date, the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares from us) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged 
are immediately and irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this 
Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee 
may not be us or one of our Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that they are dealt with in 
accordance with the provisions described in paragraphs 3 and 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below. 
3. 
Where Ordinary Shares are issued to one or more nominees in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 
2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above, each person who is for the time being shown in the records of the 
relevant Depositary or Depositaries as the holder of the corresponding Subordinated Notes immediately prior to 
Exchange (Depositary Participant, in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a Depositary as to the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of such Subordinated Notes standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive 
and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) may, no later than 30 days following the relevant 
Exchange Date (Depositary Cut-Off Date), provide to us and the relevant nominee: 
 
its name and address for entry into any register of title and receipt of any certificate or holding statement in 
respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange; 
 
the security account details of the holder of Subordinated Notes in CHESS or such other account to which the 
Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange are to be credited; and 
 
such other information as is reasonably requested by us, 
and, if it does so, the nominee will transfer the relevant Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant as soon as 
possible thereafter. 
4. 
If a Depositary Participant: 
 
fails to provide the information required by the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section above by the Depositary Cut-off Date; 
 
notifies us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares on or prior to the Depositary Cut-off Date; or 
 
would be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder if the Depositary Participants name had been entered in a 
register as the owner of the Subordinated Notes immediately prior to Exchange, 
then, with effect from the Depositary Cut-off Date, the Depositary Participant will cease to be entitled to receive the 
relevant Ordinary Shares and, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares after the Depositary Cut-off Date, the

relevant nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the Depositary 
Participant. 
5. 
Where a nominee is to be issued with Ordinary Shares under the provisions described in this section, on and from the 
date of issue of those Ordinary Shares, the relevant Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) are taken to have been Exchanged and the only rights of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or the Depositary Participant (as the case may be) in respect of such Subordinated Notes (or 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are:  
 
where the provisions described in paragraphs 1 or 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above 
applies, to require the nominee to pay it the Attributable Proceeds; or  
 
where the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above applies and 
the Depositary Participant complies with the conditions set forth in that paragraph, to require the nominee 
to effect a transfer of those Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant. 
6. 
If, where the provisions described in this section apply: 
 
the Exchange fails to take effect; and 
 
we have not otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the relevant nominee within five Business Days after the 
date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then the rights of the holders of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) are immediately and irrevocably terminated as described in Automatic 
Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot 
occur above. 
Exchange of a percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount  
If, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is necessary to Exchange a 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount, the provisions described in this section  Exchange Mechanics will apply to 
the Exchange as if references to the Outstanding Principal Amount were references to the relevant percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount to be Exchanged. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is not 
necessary to Exchange all of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, and either (a) a holder of 
Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or nominee for a common depository for any one or more Depositaries or (b) an Exchange of 
some only of the Subordinated Notes could result in the Exchange being applied among holders of Subordinated Notes or 
Depositary Participants (as applicable) other than on a pro-rata basis, the Exchange will be effected by the relevant percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note being Exchanged. 
Holder of Subordinated Notes acknowledgements  
Each holder of Subordinated Notes irrevocably:  
 
consents to becoming a member of CBA upon Exchange of the Subordinated Notes as required by the conditions 
described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section and agrees to be bound by our Constitution, in each 
case in respect of the Ordinary Shares issued to such holder of Subordinated Notes on Exchange;  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
23 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
unless (x) it has given notice in accordance with the provisions described in  Exchange where the holder of 
Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder above that it 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of the Exchange or (y) it is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, 
acknowledges and agrees that it is obliged to accept Ordinary Shares if it holds Subordinated Notes that are required 
to be Exchanged as and when required by the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes 
section notwithstanding anything that might otherwise affect Exchange including: 
 
any change in our financial position since the issue of such Subordinated Notes; 
 
any disruption to the market or potential market for the Ordinary Shares or to capital markets generally;  
 
any breach by us of any obligation in connection with the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
any failure to or delay in exchange, conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities; and 
 
acknowledges and agrees that: 
 
it will not have any rights to vote in respect of any Exchange or Write Down; 
 
it has no claim against us for any loss it may suffer arising in connection with any Exchange or Write Down;  
 
it has no rights to compensation from, or any other remedies against, us or any other member of the CBA 
Group on account of the failure of us to issue Ordinary Shares if we are for any reason prevented from doing 
so;  
 
Exchange is not subject to any conditions other than those expressly provided for in Automatic Exchange 
or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event and this Exchange Mechanics 
section; and 
 
it has no right to request Exchange or to determine whether (or in what circumstances) the Subordinated 
Notes it holds are Exchanged. 
Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  
Each Subordinated Note will be redeemed on the maturity date for its Outstanding Principal Amount unless we have previously 
conducted a Subordinated Note Repurchase or Subordinated Note Redemption or Exchanged or Written Down the 
Subordinated Notes in full. 
APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase 
A Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase may only occur before the maturity date if APRA has given 
its prior written approval to the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. Approval is at the discretion 
of APRA. Holders of Subordinated Notes should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for a Subordinated Note 
Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. 
Additionally, we may only conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase before the maturity date 
if either:  
 
before or concurrently with the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase we replace the 
Subordinated Notes with a capital instrument which is of the same or better quality (for the purposes of APRAs 
prudential standards as they are applied to the CBA Group at the relevant time) than the Subordinated Notes and the 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
24 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
replacement of the Subordinated Notes is done under conditions that are sustainable for the income capacity of CBA; 
or 
 
we obtain confirmation from APRA that APRA is satisfied, having regard to the capital position of the CBA Level 1 
Group and the CBA Level 2 Group, that we do not have to replace the Subordinated Notes.  
Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be redeemed at the option of a holder of such Subordinated Note. 
As described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase, 
we may redeem prior to the maturity date in whole but not in part, the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note 
Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events, as described below. Because the 2034 
Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement specifies that an issuer call is applicable, we may also redeem all of the 2034 
Subordinated Notes on the Optional Redemption Date. The Optional Redemption Date will be September 12, 2029.  
Any Subordinated Note Redemption as described below under Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of 
certain tax events and Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events will be made at 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, which shall be equal to 100% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes redeemed pursuant to the Subordinated Note Redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but 
excluding) the Subordinated Note Redemption Date. If we have provided a notice of Subordinated Note Redemption, the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes called for Subordinated Note Redemption shall become due on the 
Subordinated Note Redemption Date. On and after the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, unless we default in payment of 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, interest shall cease to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes. 
If we elect to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption, we will provide holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agent 
with at least 20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business Days) irrevocable notice (for the avoidance of doubt, an 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption). Notices of a 
Subordinated Note Redemption shall be given by us in writing and for so long as any Subordinated Notes are held by the 
Depositary, given to each holder in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Depositary relating to the delivery of 
notices, or mailed to their last addresses appearing on the register of the Subordinated Notes. Notices of a Subordinated Note 
Redemption shall specify the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, the place 
or places of payment and that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Notes which are the 
subject of the Subordinated Note Redemption.  
All Subordinated Notes which are the subject of a Subordinated Note Redemption will be cancelled forthwith and all our 
liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged.  
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events  
Subject to the requirements described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we receive an opinion from reputable legal counsel or other 
tax adviser in Australia, experienced in such matters, to the effect that there is a material risk that as a result of a change in laws 
of Australia (including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment which has been or will be 
introduced), we would be exposed to a more than de minimis adverse tax consequence in relation to the Subordinated Notes 
other than a tax consequence we expected as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected as at the date 
of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Tax Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of the Subordinated 
Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date. 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
25 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If we choose to redeem the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a 
Tax Event, then immediately prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption of Subordinated Notes pursuant 
to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated 
Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right 
to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which we would be subject to the adverse tax consequence. Such notice 
shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred and state that we have 
elected to exercise our option to conduct the Subordinated Note Redemption in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated 
Notes. 
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we determine that as a result of a change in the laws of 
Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards (including following any announcement of a prospective change or 
amendment which has been or will be introduced) all, some or a percentage of all or some Subordinated Notes are not or will 
not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the CBA Group under APRAs prudential standards (as amended from time to time), other 
than as a result of a change of treatment expected by us as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected 
as at the date of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Regulatory Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of 
the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date.  
If we choose to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a Regulatory Event, then immediately 
prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption pursuant to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent 
an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable 
detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have 
occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which all, some or a percentage of all or some of the Subordinated Notes 
will cease to be treated as Tier 2 Capital. Such notice shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note 
Redemption have occurred and state that we have elected to exercise our option to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption 
in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Notes. 
Subordinated Note Repurchase 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, we or any member of the CBA Group may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and 
regulations, at any time purchase Subordinated Notes in the open market, by tender to all or some of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or by private agreement or otherwise at any price (Subordinated Note Repurchase). All Subordinated 
Notes repurchased by us or any member of the CBA Group as a result of a Subordinated Note Repurchase will be cancelled 
forthwith and all our liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged. 
Mergers and similar transactions 
We are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another person. We are also permitted to sell substantially all of our 
assets to another person, or to buy substantially all of the assets of another person.  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
26 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met: 
 
where we merge out of existence or sell our assets, except as otherwise indicated below, the other person must be an 
entity organized as a corporation, trust or partnership, it must expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of and interest, if any, on the Subordinated Notes and the performance of every 
covenant included in the Subordinated Notes; 
 
we deliver to the holders of the Subordinated Notes an officers certificate and opinion of counsel, each stating that 
the consolidation, merger, sale, lease or purchase of assets complies with the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not cause a default on the Subordinated Notes, and we must not 
already be in default under the Subordinated Notes, unless the merger or other transaction would cure the default. 
If such person is not organized and validly existing under the laws of Australia, it must expressly agree: 
 
to indemnify the holder of the Subordinated Notes against any tax, assessment or governmental charge required to be 
withheld or deducted from any payment to such holder as a consequence of such merger, sale of assets or other 
transaction, provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any deduction or withholding imposed or 
required pursuant to Section 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official 
interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or 
regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code, and shall not require the payment of additional 
amounts on account of any such withholding or deduction); and 
 
that all payments pursuant to the Subordinated Notes must be made without withholding or deduction for or on 
account of any tax of whatever nature imposed or levied on behalf of the jurisdiction of organization of such person, 
or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such tax is required by such jurisdiction or any 
such subdivision or authority to be withheld or deducted, in which case such person will pay such additional amounts 
in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Subordinated Notes after such withholding or deduction 
will equal the amount which would have been received in respect of the Subordinated Notes in the absence of such 
withholding or deduction, subject to the same exceptions as would apply with respect to the payment by us of 
additional amounts in respect of the Subordinated Notes (substituting the jurisdiction of organization of such person 
for Australia). 
Upon any such consolidation or merger, or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Issuer 
substantially as an entirety in accordance with the provisions described in this Mergers and similar transactions section 
above, the successor person formed by such consolidation or into which we are merged or to which such conveyance, transfer 
or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, us under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes with the same effect as if the successor person had been named as the Issuer therein 
and herein and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor person shall be relieved of all obligations and 
covenants under the Subordinated Notes and under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the above, the terms of the Subordinated Notes do not prevent us from consolidating with or merging into any 
other person or conveying, transferring or leasing our respective properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any 
person, or from permitting any person to consolidate with or merge into us or to convey, transfer or lease our respective 
properties and assets substantially as an entirety to us where such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease is: 
 
required by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) under law and prudential regulation 
applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia (including, without limitation, the Australian Banking Act or the 
Australian FSBT Act, as used herein, and any amendments thereto, rules thereunder and any successor laws, 
amendments and rules); or  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
27 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
determined by us or by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) to be necessary in order for 
us to be managed in a sound and prudent manner or for us or APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official 
appointed by it) to resolve any financial difficulties affecting us, in each case in accordance with law and prudential 
regulation applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia. 
It is possible that the merger, sale of assets or other transaction would cause some of our property to become subject to a 
mortgage or other legal mechanism giving lenders preferential rights in that property over other lenders or over our general 
creditors if we fail to pay them back. 
Payment of additional amounts  
We will pay all amounts that we are required to pay on the Subordinated Notes without withholding or deduction for, or on 
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed or levied by or on behalf of 
Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. This obligation will not apply, however, if those taxes, 
duties, assessments or other governmental charges are required by Australia or any such subdivision or taxing authority to be 
withheld or deducted (including withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in section 1471(b) of 
the Code). If that were to occur, we will pay additional amounts of, or in respect of, the principal of, and any premium and 
interest on, the affected Subordinated Notes (additional amounts) that are necessary so that the net amounts paid to the 
holders of those Subordinated Notes, after deduction or withholding, will equal the amounts of principal and any premium and 
interest that we would have had to pay on those Subordinated Notes if the deduction or withholding had not been required 
except that our obligation to pay additional amounts in relation to the Subordinated Notes will not apply to: 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed 
but for the fact that the holder of the affected Subordinated Note: 
 
was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment 
or was physically present in, Australia or otherwise had some connection with Australia other than only 
owning that Subordinated Note, or receiving payments under that Subordinated Note; 
 
presented that Subordinated Note for payment in Australia, unless he or she was required to present that 
Subordinated Note for payment and it could not have been presented for payment anywhere else; or 
 
presented that Subordinated Note more than 30 days after the date payment became due on that 
Subordinated Note or was provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have 
been entitled to the additional amounts on presenting the Subordinated Note for payment on any day during 
that 30 day period;  
 
any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge 
or any withholding or deduction on account of those taxes; 
 
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from 
payments of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on the affected Subordinated Note; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
holder or the beneficial owner of the affected Subordinated Note did not comply with our request: 
 
to provide information concerning his or her nationality, residence or identity; or 
 
to make a declaration or other similar claim or satisfy any requirement for information or reporting,

which, in the case of each of the two preceding bullet points, is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or 
administrative practice of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in Australia as a condition to an 
exemption from all or part of the withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
person who receives the payment is our associate as defined in section 128F of the Australian Tax Act; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duties, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by 
reason of the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia giving a notice under Section 255 of the 
Australian Tax Act or Section 260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 of the Commonwealth of 
Australia; 
 
any withholding or deduction due to a determination having been made under Part IVA of the Australian Tax Act (or 
any modification thereof or provision substituted therefor) by the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of 
Australia that withholding tax is payable in respect of a payment in circumstances where that payment would not have 
been subject to withholding tax because of a scheme which had the dominant purpose of causing the payment not to 
be subject to withholding tax;  
 
any withholding or deduction that is imposed by reason of the failure of a person entitled to such payment to perfect 
an exemption from any withholding or deduction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of any payment 
being made through an intermediary that is subject to withholding or deduction) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 
through 1474 of the Code and any regulations or agreements thereunder or official interpretations thereof; or 
 
any combination of the foregoing bullet points.  
The term associate is widely defined for the purposes of section 128F of the Australian Tax Act. It would include: 
 
a person who controls a majority voting interest in us or is able to sufficiently influence us; 
 
any trust under which we, or any of our subsidiaries, can benefit; and 
 
any entity which we can sufficiently influence or in which we have a majority voting interest, even where that entity 
acts as trustee. 
No additional amounts shall be payable with respect to any payment of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of, 
or any interest on, any Subordinated Note to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner 
of such payment to the extent that payment would, under the laws of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of 
Australia, be treated as being derived or received for tax purposes by a beneficiary or settlor of that fiduciary or a member of 
that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to those additional amounts had it been the actual 
holder of the affected Subordinated Note. 
In addition, any amounts to be paid on the Subordinated Notes will be paid, and any Ordinary Shares to be delivered as a result 
of an Exchange of such Subordinated Notes will be delivered, net of any deduction, withholding, interest or penalty imposed or 
required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official interpretations 
thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or 
practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such 
Sections of the Code (a FATCA Withholding), and no additional amounts will be required to be paid and no additional Ordinary 
Shares will be required to be delivered on account of any such FATCA Withholding. Each holder shall be deemed to authorize us 
to remit, or otherwise deal with, any amounts and Ordinary Shares comprising a FATCA Withholding and report information in 
accordance with applicable requirements connected therewith. 
For personal use only

Whenever we refer in this document, in any context, to the payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on any 
Subordinated Note or the net proceeds received on the sale or Exchange of any Subordinated Note, we mean to include the 
payment of additional amounts to the extent that, in that context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable. 
Any additional amounts payable on Subordinated Notes will be subordinated in right of payment, see  Status of Subordinated 
Notes above. 
Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange 
We may, without the consent of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, provided that the Substitution Conditions (as defined 
below) are satisfied, by giving notice to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and holders of the Subordinated Notes, substitute for 
ourself a non-operating holding company within the meaning of the Australian Banking Act (NOHC) as the issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (Successor). 
The notice shall specify the date on which the substitution is to take effect (the Date of Substitution).  
Substitution Conditions 
The Substitution Conditions are: 
 
by entering into a deed poll and such other documents (if any) as may be necessary to give full effect to the 
substitution (the Successor Documents), the Successor agrees with effect on and from the Date of Substitution, to 
deliver NOHC Ordinary Shares under all circumstances when we would otherwise have been required to deliver 
Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms and conditions as set out in the Subordinated Notes (with all necessary 
modifications);  
 
unless otherwise approved by APRA in writing, the Successor agrees that in all circumstances where the Successor 
delivers fully paid NOHC Ordinary Shares under the Successor Documents, the Successor or another entity (which is a 
parent entity) will simultaneously subscribe for Ordinary Shares in such amount as may be necessary to ensure that 
the capital position of our Level 1 Group and our Level 2 Group is equivalent to the position if such Successor 
Documents had not been entered into and we were required to issue the Ordinary Shares; 
 
the NOHC Ordinary Shares are or are to be quoted on ASX, and the Successor agrees to use all reasonable endeavours 
and furnish all such documents, information and undertakings as may be reasonably necessary in order to procure 
quotation of NOHC Ordinary Shares issued under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes on the securities 
exchanges on which the NOHC Ordinary Shares are quoted at the time of delivery; 
 
both we and the Successor have obtained APRA approval and all other necessary authorizations, regulatory and 
governmental approvals and consents for such substitution and for the performance by the Successor of its obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes and the documents effecting substitution; 
 
if the Successor does not have a place of business in New York, the Successor has appointed a process agent in New 
York to receive service of process on its behalf in relation to any legal proceedings arising out of or in connection with 
the Subordinated Notes;  
 
the Successor has, in our reasonable opinion, the financial capacity to satisfy its obligations under the Subordinated 
Notes;  
 
we have used all reasonable endeavours to give an irrevocable notice to the holders of the Subordinated Notes as 
soon as practicable before the Board initiates a restructure of the CBA Group and a NOHC becomes our ultimate 
holding company (a NOHC Event), but no later than 10 Business Days before the NOHC Event occurs, specifying the 
amendments to the Subordinated Notes which will be made under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
30 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
in connection with the substitution of a NOHC as the issuer of Ordinary Shares on Exchange and such amended terms 
will have effect on and from the date specified in the notice; and 
 
the Successor will not be deemed to be an investment company required to register under the U.S. Investment 
Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
Effect of substitution of Successor 
If the relevant requirements set out in Substitution Conditions have been completed, on and from the Date of Substitution: 
 
we (or any corporation which has previously assumed our obligations) will be released from any obligation we would 
otherwise have under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes to issue Ordinary Shares to holders of the 
Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; and 
 
references to Ordinary Shares in the Subordinated Notes (other than the reference contained in the first two bullets 
under Substitution Conditions and in the definitions of Issue Date VWAP and VWAP Period (to the extent the 
reference applies to Issue Date VWAP only)) and the Terms Agreement will be taken to be references to the NOHC 
Ordinary Shares.  
Default, remedies and waiver of default  
Subordinated Note events of default 
A Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes if: 
(A) 
we fail to pay any amount due in respect of the Subordinated Notes and such default continues for a period of 15 
Business Days and is continuing, provided that no Subordinated Note Event of Default shall arise on account of any 
non-payment if we withhold, deduct or refuse to make the payment:  
 
in order to comply with any law or regulation or with the order of any court of competent jurisdiction, in 
each case applicable to such payment; or 
 
in case of doubt as to the validity or applicability of any such law, regulation or order, in accordance with 
advice given as to such validity or applicability, at any time during the said period of 15 Business Days, by 
independent legal advisers;  
 
to the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would not be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the Holder of Subordinated Notes); or 
(B) 
an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order successfully appealed or permanently 
stayed within 30 Business Days), or an effective resolution is passed, for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not 
elsewhere).  
Consequences of a Subordinated Note Event of Default 
If a Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes: 
 
as described under paragraph (A) of Subordinated Note events of default above, any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may institute proceedings: 
 
to recover the amount we have failed to pay, provided that we may only be compelled to pay that amount to 
the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
31 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the holder of the Subordinated 
Notes); 
 
for specific performance of any other obligation in respect of the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not elsewhere); or 
 
as described under paragraph (B) Subordinated Note events of default above, the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately due and payable for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid 
interest up to (but excluding) the date of commencement of our Winding-Up and any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may, subject to the provisions described in How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt, prove in our 
Winding-Up in respect of this amount. 
A holder of Subordinated Notes has no right to accelerate payment or exercise any other remedies (including any right to sue for 
damages) as a consequence of any Subordinated Note Event of Default other than as set out in this section.  
Modification of the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement and waiver of covenants  
The prior written approval of APRA is required to modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, or to give consents or waivers in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes or take other actions where such modification, amendment, supplement, consent, waiver or other action 
may affect the eligibility of the Subordinated Notes as Tier 2 Capital of CBA (including, for the avoidance of doubt, waivers of any 
of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as they affect the Subordinated Notes, or in the Subordinated Notes).  
If we are able to obtain APRAs prior written approval, there are three types of changes we can make to the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes and these changes might subject the holders to U.S. federal tax.  
Changes requiring each holders approval 
First, there are changes that cannot be made without the consent or the affirmative vote or approval of each holder affected by 
the change. Here is a list of those types of changes: 
 
change to due date for the payment of Outstanding Principal Amount of, or any installment of interest on any 
Subordinated Note; 
 
reduce the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated Note, the portion of any Outstanding Principal Amount 
that is payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the Subordinated Note, the interest rate or the Subordinated Note 
Early Redemption Amount, except as expressly provided in the terms of the Subordinated Notes; 
 
changes to the subordination provisions of a Subordinated Note in a manner adverse to the interests of any holder of 
the Subordinated Note; 
 
change the currency of any payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
change our obligation to pay additional amounts;  
 
change the place of payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes necessary to modify, amend or 
supplement the Fiscal Agency Agreement or the Subordinated Notes or to waive past defaults or future compliance; or

reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes required to adopt a resolution or 
the required quorum at any meeting of holders of Subordinated Notes at which a resolution is adopted. 
Changes not requiring approval  
The second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the Subordinated Notes. We may, without the vote or 
consent or affirmative vote or approval of any holder of Subordinated Notes, amend the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, if we are of the opinion that such alteration is: (i) of a 
formal, technical or minor nature; (ii) made to cure any ambiguity or correct any manifest error; (iii) necessary or expedient for 
the purposes of facilitating a substitution under the terms described in Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (including satisfying any requirement of APRA in connection with such a substitution); (iv) made 
to amend any date or time period stated, required or permitted in connection with any Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Exchange (including, without limitation, when the proceeds of a Subordinated Note Redemption are to be reinvested in a new 
security to be issued by us or a Related Body Corporate); (v) not materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated 
Notes as a whole (subject to the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval); or (vi) made to (subject to 
the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval) (x) alter the terms of any Subordinated Notes to align 
them with any Relevant Tier 2 Securities issued after the date of such Subordinated Notes; or (y) alter either or both of the 
definitions of Relevant Tier 1 Securities and Relevant Tier 2 Securities on account of the issue (after the date of issue of any 
Subordinated Notes) of capital instruments of the CBA Group, provided in each case of (vi)(x) and (vi)(y) such alteration is not 
materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated Notes as a whole.   
Changes requiring majority approval 
Any other change to the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, 
requires the following (in addition to the prior written approval of APRA):  
 
the written consent of the holders of at least 50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes 
affected by such change; or 
 
the adoption of a resolution at a meeting at which a quorum of holders of Subordinated Notes is present by at least 
50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes affected by such change represented at the 
meeting. 
The same 50% approval would be required for us to obtain a waiver of any of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement or 
the Subordinated Notes. Such covenants include the promises we make about merging, which we describe above under  
Mergers and similar transactions. If the holders approve a waiver of a covenant, we will not have to comply with it. 
If approved in accordance with the terms described in this section, then all holders of Subordinated Notes, including holders 
who did not provide their written consent or attend and vote at a relevant meeting and holders who voted in a manner contrary 
to the majority, will be bound by such change. 
The quorum at any meeting called to adopt a resolution will be persons holding or representing a majority in Outstanding 
Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes and, at any reconvened meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum, 25% of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes. For purposes of determining whether holders of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of Subordinated Notes required for any action or vote, or for any quorum, have taken the action or vote, or 
constitute a quorum, the Outstanding Principal Amount of any particular Subordinated Note may differ from its Outstanding 
Principal Amount at the maturity date but will not exceed its stated face amount upon original issuance. 
Unless otherwise indicated, we will be entitled to set any day as a record date for determining which holders of book-entry 
Subordinated Notes are entitled to make, take or give requests, demands, authorizations, directions, notices, consents, waivers 
or other action, or to vote on actions, authorized or permitted by the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. In

addition, record dates for any book-entry Subordinated Note may be set in accordance with procedures established by the 
Depositary from time to time. Therefore, record dates for book-entry Subordinated Notes may differ from those for other 
Subordinated Notes. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how 
approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the Fiscal Agency Agreement or any Subordinated Notes or request a 
waiver. 
Only outstanding Subordinated Notes are eligible 
Only holders of outstanding Subordinated Notes will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of Subordinated Notes. 
Also, we will count only outstanding Subordinated Notes in determining whether the various percentage requirements for 
taking action have been met. For these purposes, a Subordinated Note will not be outstanding: 
 
if it has been surrendered for cancellation;  
 
to the extent it has been Written Down; 
 
if we have called such Subordinated Note for a Subordinated Note Redemption or it has become due and payable at 
maturity or otherwise and we have deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or 
Subordinated Note Redemption;  
 
if it is in lieu of or in substitution for other Subordinated Notes that have been authenticated and delivered; 
 
if we are the direct or indirect owner; or  
 
if it has been Exchanged.  
Form, exchange and transfer of Subordinated Notes 
If any Subordinated Notes cease to be issued in registered global form, they will be issued:  
 
only in fully registered form;  
 
without interest coupons; and  
 
unless we indicate otherwise, in denominations of US$200,000 or integral multiple of US$1,000 in excess thereof. 
Holders may exchange their Subordinated Notes for Subordinated Notes of smaller denominations or combine them into fewer 
Subordinated Notes of larger denominations, as long as the total Outstanding Principal Amount is not changed.  
Holders may exchange or transfer their Subordinated Notes at the office of the Fiscal Agent. They may also replace lost, stolen, 
destroyed or mutilated Subordinated Notes at that office. We have appointed the Fiscal Agent to act as our agent for registering 
Subordinated Notes in the names of holders and transferring and replacing Subordinated Notes. We may appoint another entity 
to perform these functions or perform them ourselves. 
Holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their Subordinated Notes, but they may be required 
to pay for any tax or other governmental charge associated with the exchange or transfer. The transfer or exchange, and any 
replacement, will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holders proof of legal ownership. The transfer agent 
may require an indemnity before replacing any Subordinated Notes. 
We may appoint additional transfer agents or cancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. We may also approve a 
change in the office through which any transfer agent acts.

If any Subordinated Notes are redeemable pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption and we redeem less than all those 
Subordinated Notes, we may block the transfer or exchange of those Subordinated Notes during the period beginning 15 days 
before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to 
prepare the mailing, and refuse to register transfers of or exchange any Subordinated Note selected for redemption, except that 
we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any Subordinated Note being partially 
redeemed. 
If a Subordinated Note is issued as a Global Note, only the Depositary  i.e., DTC  will be entitled to transfer and exchange the 
Subordinated Note as described in this subsection, since the Depositary will be the sole holder of the Subordinated Note. 
The rules for exchange described above apply to exchange of Subordinated Notes for other Subordinated Notes of the same 
kind.  
Payment mechanics for Subordinated Notes 
Who receives payment? 
If interest is due on a Subordinated Note on an interest payment date, we will pay the interest to the person in whose name the 
Subordinated Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date relating to the interest payment date, see 
 Payment of interest below. If interest is due at the maturity date, we will pay the interest to the person entitled to receive 
the principal of the Subordinated Note. If principal or another amount besides interest is due on a Subordinated Note at the 
maturity date, we will pay the amount to the holder of the Subordinated Note against surrender of the Subordinated Note at a 
proper place of payment or, in the case of a Global Note, in accordance with the applicable policies of the Depositary, which will 
be DTC. 
Payment of interest 
For each interest payment date, the interest to be paid in arrears to (but excluding) the interest payment date shall be that 
which has accrued from (and including) the prior interest payment date. Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year 
comprised of twelve 30-day calendar months. If any interest payment date for the Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a 
Business Day, the interest payment shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment 
shall accrue for the period from and after the interest payment date. If the maturity date or any earlier Redemption Date falls on 
a day that is not a Business Day, payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest otherwise due on such day will be 
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such 
maturity date, or Redemption Date, as the case may be. 
No interest will accrue on any Subordinated Notes, or relevant percentage of Subordinated Notes, required to be Exchanged in 
the period from (and including) the interest payment date that immediately precedes the Exchange Date or (in the case where 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down) the Write Down Date to the Exchange Date or Write Down Date, as applicable.  
Interest rate reset 
If all of the 2034 Subordinated Notes have not been redeemed, repurchased, cancelled, Exchanged or Written Down by the 
Interest Reset Date, the interest, payable on the Outstanding Principal Amount semi-annually in arrears for the period from, and 
including, the Interest Reset Date to, but excluding, the maturity date shall be reset to a fixed rate per annum equaling the Reset 
Reference Rate plus the Spread. 
How we will make payments on Global Notes  
We will make payments on a Global Note in accordance with the applicable policies as in effect from time to time of the 
Depositary, which will be DTC. Under those policies, we will pay directly to the Depositary, or its nominee, and not to any 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
35 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the Global Note. An indirect owners right to receive those payments will be 
governed by the rules and practices of the Depositary and its participants. 
Paying Agent 
We may appoint one or more financial institutions to act as our paying agents, at whose designated offices Subordinated Notes 
in non-global entry form may be surrendered for payment at their maturity. We call each of those financial institutions a Paying 
Agent. We may add, replace or terminate Paying Agents from time to time; provided that at all times there will be a Paying 
Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. We may also choose to act as our own Paying Agent. Initially, we 
have appointed The Bank of New York Mellon, as the Paying Agent. We must notify the Fiscal Agent of changes in the Paying 
Agents.  
Unclaimed payments 
Regardless of who acts as Paying Agent, all money paid by us to a Paying Agent that remains unclaimed at the end of two years 
after the amount is due to a holder will be repaid to us. After that two-year period, the holder may look only to us for payment 
and not to the Fiscal Agent, any other Paying Agent or anyone else. 
Notices 
Notices to be given to holders of a Global Note will be given only to the Depositary, in accordance with its applicable policies as 
in effect from time to time. Notices to be given to holders of Subordinated Notes not in global form will be sent by mail to the 
respective addresses of the holders as they appear in the Fiscal Agents records, and will be deemed given when mailed. Neither 
the failure to give any notice to a particular holder, nor any defect in a notice given to a particular holder, will affect the 
sufficiency of any notice given to another holder. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for 
information on how they will receive notices. 
Nothing in the above paragraph affects the Exchange or Write Down of the Subordinated Notes as described under  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  Exchange. 
Our relationship with the Fiscal Agent 
The Bank of New York Mellon is serving as the Fiscal Agent for the Subordinated Notes issued under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement. The Bank of New York Mellon has provided services for us and our affiliates in the past and may do so in the future. 
Among other things, The Bank of New York Mellon serves as fiscal agent with regard to some of our other debt obligations. 
Successor fiscal agent 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that the Fiscal Agent may be removed by us at any time or may resign upon 30 days prior 
written notice to us or any shorter period that we accept, effective upon the acceptance by a successor fiscal agent of its 
appointment. The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that any successor fiscal agent must have an established place of business 
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and a combined capital and surplus in excess of US$50,000,000. We must 
notify the holders of the Subordinated Notes of the appointment of a successor fiscal agent. 
Governing law 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us, the subordination 
provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Status and Subordination of Subordinated Notes above, the Exchange 
and Write Down provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the 
occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event above and the substitution provisions described above under Substitution of a

connection with any action arising out of the sale of the Subordinated Notes or enforcement of the terms of the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement.

The information included in the following sections of this document is based on material in the Offering Circular and the 2039 
Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement. 
The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations and claims in respect of Subordinated Notes will 
rank in our Winding-Up after the claims of all Senior Ranking Obligations, pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking 
Securities and ahead of claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities, as further defined and described below under How the 
Subordinated Notes rank against other debt.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs prior to the maturity date or earlier Subordinated Note Redemption, we must Exchange all 
or some of the Subordinated Notes or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case 
may be and in an amount as determined as described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event below) for Ordinary Shares. A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing 
that it believes (i) an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA 
Group, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable or (ii) a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable. 
If, for any reason, an Exchange fails to take effect and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in 
respect of such Exchange within five Business Days after the occurrence of the applicable Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the 
rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest and 
to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes or the percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down. See Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event for more information.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If the amount of our Relevant Tier 1 Securities is not sufficient to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable, some or all 
of our Relevant Tier 2 Securities, including the Subordinated Notes, will be subject to Exchange or Write Down. See  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event below.  
A Subordinated Note Redemption may, subject to the terms described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated 
Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances, occur at our option, in whole but not in 
part, following the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events.  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued only in fully registered form in denominations of US$200,000 and integral multiples of 
US$1,000 in excess thereof (the Specified Denomination). 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Fiscal Agency Agreement and its associated 
documents, including the Subordinated Notes and the 2039 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, contain the full legal text 
of the matters described in this section entitled Description of the Subordinated Notes. This section is a summary only and 
does not describe every aspect of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. For example, in this section and the 
2039 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, we use terms that have been given special meaning in the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement, but we describe the meaning of only the more important of those terms.  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us and the subordination, 
Exchange, Write Down and substitution provisions of the Subordinated Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the law applying in New South Wales, Australia.  
Copies of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the form of Subordinated Note are available for inspection during normal business 
hours at the office of the Fiscal Agent.  
The Fiscal Agent performs administrative duties for us such as sending interest payments and notices to holders. See  Our 
relationship with the Fiscal Agent below for more information about the Fiscal Agent.  
We may issue other debt securities  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes do not limit our ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other 
securities. Also, we are not subject to financial covenants or similar restrictions by the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt 
Loss absorption does not apply to our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
The requirement for a conversion or write down on account of our non-viability does not apply to an amount of our 
subordinated debt that was issued prior to January 1, 2013. Accordingly, holders of Subordinated Notes are likely to be in a 
worse position in the event we become non-viable than holders of our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
because that subordinated debt generally does not require that it be exchanged or written down upon the occurrence of a Non-
Viability Trigger Event.

Status of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will not be secured by any of our property or assets. Thus, by owning a Subordinated Note, a holder of 
a Subordinated Noted is an unsecured creditor. The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations 
and will rank pari passu with Equal Ranking Securities.  
The liabilities which are preferred by law to the claim of a holder in respect of the Subordinated Notes are substantial. The terms 
and conditions of the Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of such liabilities which we may incur or assume from time to 
time. 
Each holder should be aware that, if we are in a Winding-Up, it is possible that a Non-Viability Trigger Event will have already 
occurred, following which the holders Subordinated Notes may be, or may have already been, Exchanged for Ordinary Shares or 
Written Down. See  How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt and  Default, remedies and waiver of default 
below for additional information on how subordination limits the ability of holders of Subordinated Notes to receive payment or 
pursue other rights if we default or have certain other financial difficulties.  
Claims in respect of Subordinated Notes rank in our Winding-Up: 
 
after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims preferred by applicable laws;  
 
pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking Securities; and  
 
ahead of all claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims referred to in Sections 563AA and 563A of 
the Corporations Act.  
The applicable laws referred to above include (but are not limited to) Sections 13A and 16 of the Australian Banking Act and 
Section 86 of the Reserve Bank Act. These provisions provide that, in the event that we becomes unable to meet our obligations 
or suspend payment, our assets in Australia are to be available to meet our liabilities to, among others, APRA, the RBA and 
holders of protected accounts held in Australia, in priority to all other liabilities, including the Subordinated Notes. 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. The Subordinated Notes do not constitute 
deposit liabilities or protected accounts for us in Australia for the purposes of the Australian Banking Act and are not insured or 
guaranteed by the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any government, governmental agency or 
compensation scheme of the United States, Australia or any other jurisdiction or by any other party.   
In our Winding-Up, payments on each Subordinated Note are subject to: (i) all holders of Senior Ranking Obligations being paid 
in full before any payment is made to holders of Subordinated Notes; and (ii) holders of Subordinated Notes and holders of 
Equal Ranking Securities being paid on a pro-rata basis.  
We expect that from time to time we will incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that will constitute Senior Ranking 
Obligations. The Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of our obligations that can rank ahead of the Subordinated Notes 
that we may incur or assume in the future. 
Equal Ranking Securities means any instrument that ranks in our Winding-Up as the most junior claim in our Winding-Up 
ranking senior to Junior Ranking Securities, and includes: 
 
if on issue at the commencement of our Winding-Up, the JPY20,000,000,000 Perpetual Subordinated Callable 
Fixed/Floating Rate Reverse Dual Currency Securities issued by us in 1999; and 
 
any other instruments, present and future, issued after January 1, 2013 as instruments constituting Tier 2 Capital.

45 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Junior Ranking Securities means:  
 
any instrument, present and future, issued by us which qualifies as Tier 1 Capital (or, in the case of any instrument 
issued prior to January 1, 2013), was treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in accordance with the prudential standards 
which applied prior to January 1, 2013, irrespective of whether or not such instrument is treated as constituting Tier 1 
Capital in accordance with any transitional arrangements provided by APRA or which rank or are expressed to rank 
equally with such securities in our Winding-Up; and  
 
all of our Ordinary Shares. 
Senior Ranking Obligations means all our present and future deposits and other liabilities, securities and other obligations 
which would be entitled to be admitted in our Winding-Up (and including, but not limited to, obligations in respect of 
instruments issued before January 1, 2013 as Tier 2 Capital) other than Equal Ranking Securities and Junior Ranking Securities.  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of us, any holder of a Subordinated Note or any person claiming 
through us or a holder of a Subordinated Note has any right of set-off in respect of any amounts owed by one person to the 
other person. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement, each holder irrevocably acknowledges and 
agrees that: 
 
the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes are a debt subordination for the purposes of Section 563C of 
the Australian Corporations Act;  
 
the debt subordination is not affected by our act or omission, or any act or omission of any holder of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, which might otherwise affect holders of Subordinated Notes at law or in equity; 
 
it must not exercise its voting rights as an unsecured creditor in our Winding-Up or administration in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes to defeat the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
it must pay or deliver to the liquidator any amount or asset received on account of its claim in the Winding-Up in 
excess of its entitlement under the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes. 
For the avoidance of doubt, but subject as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence 
of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot occur, if a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred, 
holders of Subordinated Notes will rank in our Winding-Up as holders of the number of Ordinary Shares to which they became 
entitled as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
Form of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued in global  i.e., book-entry  form represented by a global security registered in the 
name of a depositary, which will be the holder of all the Subordinated Notes represented by the global security.  
Subordinated Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (Securities Act) will be represented by one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Rule 144A Global Note), 
registered in the name of a nominee of The Depositary Trust Company (DTC). Subordinated Notes sold outside of the United 
States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be represented by 
one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Regulation S Global Note and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the 
Global Notes) registered in the name of a nominee of DTC or a common depositary for DTC (the Depositary).

Those who own beneficial interests in a Global Note will do so through participants in the Depositarys securities clearance 
system, and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the Depositary and its 
participants.  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  
Non-Viability Trigger Event 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes: 
 
an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA Group, 
is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable; or 
 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-
viable. 
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital instruments which must be Exchanged, Written Down, converted or written 
down (as applicable). 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, we must Exchange in accordance with Exchange and No further rights if Exchange 
cannot occur below such number of Subordinated Notes (or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) as is equal (taking into account any conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities 
as defined below) to the aggregate face value of capital instruments which APRA has notified us must be exchanged, converted 
or written down (or, if APRA has not so notified us, such number or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note as is necessary to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable). If a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable, we must Exchange all Subordinated Notes.  
In determining the number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, which must be Exchanged in accordance with this section, we will: 
 
first, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 1 Securities whose terms require or permit, 
or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange of the 
Subordinated Notes; 
 
secondly, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or 
permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange 
of the Subordinated Notes; and  
 
thirdly, if exchange, conversion or write down of those securities is not sufficient, Exchange (in the case of the 
Subordinated Notes) or exchange, convert or write down (in the case of any other Relevant Tier 2 Securities) on a pro-
rata basis or in a manner that is otherwise, in our opinion, fair and reasonable, the Subordinated Notes and any other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be 
exchanged, converted or written down in that manner (subject to such adjustments as we may determine to take into 
account the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares and any Subordinated Notes or other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities remaining on issue),  
but such determination will not impede the immediate Exchange of the relevant number of Subordinated Notes or percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be).  
Relevant Security means a Relevant Tier 1 Security and a Relevant Tier 2 Security. 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
47 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Relevant Tier 1 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 1 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
Relevant Tier 2 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 2 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, then: 
 
the relevant number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, must be Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event in accordance with 
Exchange and Exchange Mechanics below and the Exchange will be irrevocable; 
 
we must give notice as soon as practicable that Exchange has occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the 
holders of Subordinated Notes; 
 
the notice must specify the date on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred; and 
 
the notice must specify the details of the Exchange process, including any details which were taken into account in 
relation to the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, and the impact on any 
Subordinated Notes remaining on issue. 
Failure to undertake any of the steps in the paragraph above does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise impede Exchange or 
Write Down, respectively. 
For the purposes of the foregoing, where the specified currency of the face value of Relevant Tier 1 Securities, Relevant Tier 2 
Securities and/or Subordinated Notes (as applicable) is not Australian Dollars, we may treat them as if converted into Australian 
Dollars using the Exchange Date Cross Rate. 
Exchange 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be Exchanged at the option of a holder thereof. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred and all or some of the Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are required to be Exchanged in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then: 
 
Exchange of the relevant Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each 
Subordinated Note will occur in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event and Exchange Mechanics 
immediately upon the date of occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event; and 
 
the entry of the corresponding Subordinated Note in each relevant holding of a holder of Subordinated Notes in the 
register of the Depositary will constitute an entitlement of that holder of Subordinated Notes (or, where the provisions 
described under Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, of the nominee) to the relevant number of 
Ordinary Shares (and, if applicable, also to any remaining balance of the Subordinated Notes or remaining percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note), and we will recognize the holder of Subordinated 
Notes (or, where Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, the nominee) as having been issued the 
relevant Ordinary Shares for all purposes, 
in each case without the need for any further act or step by us, the holder of the Subordinated Note or any other person (and 
we will, as soon as possible thereafter and without delay on our part, take any appropriate procedural steps to record such 
Exchange, including to procure the updating of the register of the Depositary and the Ordinary Share register and seek quotation 
of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange).

48 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
In relation to an Exchange, we shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary of the percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note that has been Exchanged and instruct the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary to reflect this 
Exchange in the relevant Global Note or other certificate representing the Subordinated Notes so that the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of such Subordinated Note is reduced by the relevant percentage. In the case of an Exchange of only part of a 
Subordinated Note, upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Note, we will issue a new Subordinated Note in the 
name of the holder with a reduced Outstanding Principal Amount reflecting the Exchange.  
For the avoidance of doubt: 
 
nothing in the Subordinated Notes will allow a payment to be made to a holder of Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; 
and 
 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption issued as 
described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated 
Notes under certain circumstances. 
Exchange means the exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes or a percentage of each Subordinated Note for Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and Exchanged has a corresponding meaning. 
No further rights if Exchange cannot occur 
If for any reason, Exchange of any Subordinated Note or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated 
Note required to be Exchanged described under Non-Viability Trigger Event fails to take effect as described in Exchange 
and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business 
Days after the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated 
Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest, and the right to receive Ordinary Shares) in 
relation to such Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately and irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the 
occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event (Written Down). We must give notice as soon as practicable that Write Down has 
occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes, and the notice must specify the date on 
which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred.  
Appointment of Appointed Person 
Each holder of a Subordinated Note, on behalf of itself and (in the case of any Global Note) any person owning an indirect 
interest in such Subordinated Note, irrevocably: 
 
appoints us and our duly authorized officers and any liquidator, administrator, statutory manager or other similar 
official of CBA (each an Appointed Person) severally to be the attorney of the holder and the agents of the holder, 
with the power in the name and on behalf of the holder to: 
 
do all such acts and things (including, without limitation signing all documents, instruments or transfers or 
instructing CHESS) as may, in the opinion of the Appointed Person, be necessary or desirable to be done in 
order to give effect to, record or perfect an Exchange or Write Down (as applicable); 
 
do all other things which an Appointed Person reasonably believes to be necessary or desirable to give effect 
to the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
appoint in turn its own agent or delegate; and 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
49 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
authorizes and directs us and/or the Fiscal Agent to make such entries in the register, including amendments and 
additions to the register, which we and/or the Fiscal Agent may consider necessary or desirable to record an Exchange 
or Write Down (as applicable). 
The power of attorney to be given by Subordinated Note holders in respect of the Subordinated Notes will be given for valuable 
consideration and to secure the performance by the Subordinated Note holder of the Subordinated Note holders obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes, will be irrevocable and will survive and not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity 
of the Subordinated Note holder (or, if such Subordinated Note holder is an entity, by its dissolution or termination). An 
Appointed Person will have no liability in respect of any acts duly performed in accordance with the power of attorney thereby 
given.  
Exchange Mechanics 
Exchange  
On the Exchange Date, subject to the conditions described in  Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot occur and  Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the 
holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, the following 
will apply: 
 
we will allot and issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares for each Subordinated Note (or percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) required to be Exchanged. The Exchange Number is, subject 
always to the Exchange Number being no greater than the Maximum Exchange Number, calculated according to the 
following formula: 
 
Exchange Number 
= 
Outstanding Principal Amount x Exchange Date Cross Rate 
P x VWAP 
where: 
P means 0.99. 
VWAP (expressed in Australian dollars and cents) means the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of 
Ordinary Shares traded on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period, subject to any adjustments made as described under 
 Adjustments to VWAP generally and  Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction, but the trades taken 
into account in determining such daily volume weighted average prices will exclude special crossings, crossings prior to 
the commencement of normal trading or during the closing phase or after hours adjustment phase, overnight 
crossings, overseas trades, trades pursuant to the exercise of options over Ordinary Shares, or any other trade 
determined by the Board in its discretion not to be reflective of normal trading in Ordinary Shares. 
VWAP Period means: 
 
in the case of the calculation of the Exchange Number, the period of five Business Days on which trading in 
Ordinary Shares took place immediately preceding (but not including) the Exchange Date; or 
 
in the case of the Issue Date VWAP, the period of 20 Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took 
place immediately preceding but excluding the issue date. 
Issue Date VWAP means the VWAP during the period of 20 Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took 
place immediately preceding but not including the issue date, as adjusted in accordance with the provisions described

(rounded to six decimal places) of the inverse A$/Specified Currency exchange rates published by the RBA at 
approximately 4:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on each of the Business Days during the five Business Day period immediately 
preceding (but excluding) the Exchange Date or, if such exchange rate is not published by the RBA on any of such 
Business Days, the Exchange Date Cross Rate will be the simple average of the inverse A$/Specified Currency exchange 
rate quoted by two or more independent market makers in that exchange rate, selected by us, on the Exchange Date. 
Maximum Exchange Number means a number calculated according to the following formula: 
Maximum 
Exchange 
Number 
= 
Outstanding Principal Amount x Issue Date Cross Rate 
0.20 x Issue Date VWAP 
Issue Date Cross Rate means (a) if the Specified Currency is Australian Dollars, 1; or (b) otherwise, the average 
(rounded to six decimal places) of the inverse A$/Specified Currency exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of

immediately preceding (but excluding) the issue date or, if such exchange rate is not published by the RBA on any of 
such Business Days, the Issue Date Cross Rate will be the simple average of the inverse A$/Specified Currency 
exchange rate quoted by two or more independent market makers in that exchange rate, selected by us, at 
approximately 4:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on the issue date. 
The rights of each holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of interest) in relation to each Subordinated Note that is 
being Exchanged (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note that is being Exchanged) will 
be immediately and irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) and we will apply that amount by way of 
payment for the subscription for the Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued under as described under the paragraph above. 
Each holder of Subordinated Notes is taken to have irrevocably directed that any amount payable under this section is to be 
applied as provided for in this section and no holder of Subordinated Notes has any right to payment in any other way. 
If the total number of additional Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued in respect of the aggregate holding of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes includes a fraction of an Ordinary Share, that fraction of an Ordinary Share will be disregarded. 
Subject to the conditions described in Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, where Subordinated Notes are Exchanged, we will allot 
and issue the Ordinary Shares to the holder of Subordinated Notes on the basis that the name and address set out in the register 
of holders (or, if not set out in the register, otherwise held by the Depositary) are the name and address for entry into any 
register of title and delivery of any certificate or holding statement in respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange.

Adjustments to VWAP generally 
For the purposes of calculating the VWAP under Exchange above:  
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the relevant VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted on ASX as 
cum dividend or cum any other distribution or entitlement and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary 
Shares after that date and those Ordinary Shares will no longer carry that dividend or any other distribution or 
entitlement, then the VWAP on the Business Days on which those Ordinary Shares have been quoted cum dividend or 
cum any other distribution or entitlement will be reduced by an amount (Cum Value) equal to:  
 
in the case of a cash dividend or other distribution, the amount of that dividend or other distribution;  
 
in the case of any other entitlement that is not a dividend or other distribution under the bullet above which 
is traded on ASX on any of those Business Days, the volume weighted average price of all such entitlements 
sold on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period on the Business Days on which those entitlements were traded 
(excluding trades of the kind that would be excluded in determining VWAP under the definition of that 
term); or 
 
in the case of any other entitlement which is not traded on ASX during the VWAP Period, the value of the 
entitlement as reasonably determined by our Board; and 
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted as ex dividend or 
ex any other distribution or entitlement, and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares which would 
be entitled to receive the relevant dividend, distribution or entitlement, the VWAP on the Business Days on which 
those Ordinary Shares have been quoted ex dividend or ex any other distribution or entitlement will be increased by 
the Cum Value. 
Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction 
Where, during the relevant VWAP Period, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because the Ordinary 
Shares are reconstructed, consolidated, divided or reclassified (not involving any payment or other compensation to or by 
holders of Ordinary Shares) (Reclassification) into a lesser or greater number, the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period 
which falls before the date on which trading in Ordinary Shares is conducted on a post Reclassification basis will be adjusted by 
multiplying the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period by the following formula: 
A 
B 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately after the Reclassification. 
Any adjustment made by us in accordance with the paragraph above will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated 
Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement will be construed 
accordingly. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section allows a cash payment or other distribution to be made to or by a holder of 
Subordinated Notes as part of a Reclassification or as a result of a Reclassification.

Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP generally 
For the purposes of determining the Issue Date VWAP as described under Exchange, adjustments will be made in 
accordance with Adjustments to VWAP generally and Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction  during the 
VWAP Period for the Issue Date VWAP. On and from the issue date, adjustments to the Issue Date VWAP: 
 
may be made by us in accordance with the conditions described below under Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
bonus issues, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP in certain circumstances (inclusive); 
 
if so made, will correspondingly cause an adjustment to the Maximum Exchange Number; and  
 
if so made, will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be construed accordingly. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues 
Subject to the two paragraphs at the end of this section, if we make a pro-rata bonus issue of Ordinary Shares to holders of 
Ordinary Shares generally, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted immediately in accordance with the following formula: 
V = Vo x RD/(RD + RN) 
where: 
V means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately after the application of this formula; 
Vo means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately prior to the application of this formula; 
RD means the number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately prior to the allotment of new Ordinary Shares 
pursuant to the bonus issue; and 
RN means the number of Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the bonus issue. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the paragraph above does not apply to Ordinary Shares issued as part of a bonus share plan, 
employee or executive share plan, executive option plan, share top up plan, share purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment 
plan. 
For the purposes of this section, an issue will be regarded as a bonus issue notwithstanding that we do not make offers to some 
or all holders of Ordinary Shares with registered addresses outside Australia (or to whom an offer is otherwise subject to foreign 
securities laws), provided that in so doing we are not in contravention of the ASX Listing Rules. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction 
If, at any time after the issue date, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because of a Reclassification into 
a lesser or greater number, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted by multiplying the Issue Date VWAP applicable on the Business 
Day immediately before the date of any such Reclassification by the following formula: 
A 
B 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
53 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately after the Reclassification. 
No adjustment to Issue Date VWAP in certain circumstances 
Despite the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP for capital reconstruction, no adjustment will be made to the Issue Date VWAP where any such adjustment (rounded if 
applicable) would be less than 1% of the Issue Date VWAP then in effect. 
Announcement of adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
We will notify any adjustment to the Issue Date VWAP under the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
generally, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues  and Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital 
reconstruction to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes within 10 Business Days of us 
determining the adjustment and the adjustment will be final and binding. 
Status and quotation of Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange will rank equally with all other fully paid Ordinary Shares provided that the 
rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange do not take effect until 5:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on the 
Exchange Date (or such other time required by APRA). 
We will use all reasonable endeavours to quote the Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange of the Subordinated Notes on ASX. 
Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder 
1. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and: 
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes has notified us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of 
Exchange, which notice may be given at any time on or after the issue date and prior to the Exchange Date;  
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder; or  
 
we have not received (for any reason whether or not due to the fault of that holder of Subordinated Notes) any 
information required by it in accordance with the conditions of the Subordinated Notes so as to impede us issuing the 
Ordinary Shares to a holder of Subordinated Notes on the Exchange Date, 
then, subject to the provisions described in paragraph 2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below, on the Exchange Date, 
the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged are immediately and 
irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this Exchange where the 
holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section 
below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee may not be us or one of our 
Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares, the 
nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the relevant holder of 
Subordinated Notes (unless, because the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, the 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
54 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
nominee is deemed to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, in which case such issue shall occur as soon as practicable 
after the nominee ceases to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder).  
Attributable Proceeds means the net proceeds of sale of Ordinary Shares attributable to the Subordinated Notes of 
the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes, or where the provisions described in paragraph 4 of this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder section below apply, the Depositary Participant, actually received after deducting any applicable brokerage, 
stamp duty and other taxes.  
Ineligible Subordinated Holder means a holder of Subordinated Notes who is prohibited or restricted by any 
applicable law or regulation in force in Australia (including but not limited to Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act, the 
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) of Australia, the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 (Cth) of 
Australia and Part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) of Australia) from being offered, holding or 
acquiring Ordinary Shares provided that if the relevant prohibition or restriction only applies to the holder of 
Subordinated Notes in respect of some of its Subordinated Notes, it shall only be treated as an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder in respect of those Subordinated Notes and not in respect of the balance of its Subordinated Notes), and 
includes a Foreign Subordinated Holder. We will be entitled to treat a holder of Subordinated Notes as not being an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder unless the holder of Subordinated Notes has otherwise notified us after the issue date 
and prior to the Exchange Date. 
Foreign Subordinated Holder means: 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes whose address in the register is a place outside Australia; or 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes who we believe may not be a resident of Australia and we are not satisfied 
that the laws of the country in which we believe the holder of Subordinated Notes is resident permit the 
offer of Ordinary Shares to, or holding or acquisition of Ordinary Shares by, the holder of Subordinated Notes 
(but we will not be bound to enquire into those laws), either unconditionally or after compliance with 
conditions which we, in our absolute discretion, regards as acceptable and not unduly onerous. 
2. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and the holder of Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or a nominee 
for a common depository for any one or more Depositary (such Depositary or nominee for a common depository 
acting in such capacity as is specified in the rules and regulations of the relevant Depositary or Depositaries) then, on 
the Exchange Date, the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares from us) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged 
are immediately and irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this 
Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee 
may not be us or one of our Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that they are dealt with in 
accordance with the provisions described in paragraphs 3 and 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below.

3. 
Where Ordinary Shares are issued to one or more nominees in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 
2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above, each person who is for the time being shown in the records of the 
relevant Depositary or Depositaries as the holder of the corresponding Subordinated Notes immediately prior to 
Exchange (Depositary Participant, in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a Depositary as to the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of such Subordinated Notes standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive 
and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) may, no later than 30 days following the relevant 
Exchange Date (Depositary Cut-Off Date), provide to us and the relevant nominee: 
 
its name and address for entry into any register of title and receipt of any certificate or holding statement in 
respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange; 
 
the security account details of the holder of Subordinated Notes in CHESS or such other account to which the 
Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange are to be credited; and 
 
such other information as is reasonably requested by us, 
and, if it does so, the nominee will transfer the relevant Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant as soon as 
possible thereafter. 
4. 
If a Depositary Participant: 
 
fails to provide the information required by the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section above by the Depositary Cut-off Date; 
 
notifies us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares on or prior to the Depositary Cut-off Date; or 
 
would be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder if the Depositary Participants name had been entered in a 
register as the owner of the Subordinated Notes immediately prior to Exchange, 
then, with effect from the Depositary Cut-off Date, the Depositary Participant will cease to be entitled to receive the 
relevant Ordinary Shares and, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares after the Depositary Cut-off Date, the 
relevant nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the Depositary 
Participant. 
5. 
Where a nominee is to be issued with Ordinary Shares under the provisions described in this section, on and from the 
date of issue of those Ordinary Shares, the relevant Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) are taken to have been Exchanged and the only rights of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or the Depositary Participant (as the case may be) in respect of such Subordinated Notes (or 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are:  
 
where the provisions described in paragraphs 1 or 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above 
applies, to require the nominee to pay it the Attributable Proceeds; or  
 
where the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above applies and 
the Depositary Participant complies with the conditions set forth in that paragraph, to require the nominee 
to effect a transfer of those Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant.

6. 
If, where the provisions described in this section apply: 
 
the Exchange fails to take effect; and 
 
we have not otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the relevant nominee within five Business Days after the 
date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then the rights of the holders of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) are immediately and irrevocably terminated as described in Automatic 
Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot 
occur above. 
Exchange of a percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount  
If, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is necessary to Exchange a 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount, the provisions described in this section  Exchange Mechanics will apply to 
the Exchange as if references to the Outstanding Principal Amount were references to the relevant percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount to be Exchanged. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is not 
necessary to Exchange all of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, and either (a) a holder of 
Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or nominee for a common depository for any one or more Depositaries or (b) an Exchange of 
some only of the Subordinated Notes could result in the Exchange being applied among holders of Subordinated Notes or 
Depositary Participants (as applicable) other than on a pro-rata basis, the Exchange will be effected by the relevant percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note being Exchanged. 
Holder of Subordinated Notes acknowledgements  
Each holder of Subordinated Notes irrevocably:  
 
consents to becoming a member of CBA upon Exchange of the Subordinated Notes as required by the conditions 
described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section and agrees to be bound by our Constitution, in each 
case in respect of the Ordinary Shares issued to such holder of Subordinated Notes on Exchange;  
 
unless (x) it has given notice in accordance with the provisions described in  Exchange where the holder of 
Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder above that it 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of the Exchange or (y) it is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, 
acknowledges and agrees that it is obliged to accept Ordinary Shares if it holds Subordinated Notes that are required 
to be Exchanged as and when required by the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes 
section notwithstanding anything that might otherwise affect Exchange including: 
 
any change in our financial position since the issue of such Subordinated Notes; 
 
any disruption to the market or potential market for the Ordinary Shares or to capital markets generally;  
 
any breach by us of any obligation in connection with the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
any failure to or delay in exchange, conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities; and 
 
acknowledges and agrees that: 
 
it will not have any rights to vote in respect of any Exchange or Write Down; 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
57 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
it has no claim against us for any loss it may suffer arising in connection with any Exchange or Write Down;  
 
it has no rights to compensation from, or any other remedies against, us or any other member of the CBA 
Group on account of the failure of us to issue Ordinary Shares if we are for any reason prevented from doing 
so;  
 
Exchange is not subject to any conditions other than those expressly provided for in Automatic Exchange 
or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event and this Exchange Mechanics 
section; and 
 
it has no right to request Exchange or to determine whether (or in what circumstances) the Subordinated 
Notes it holds are Exchanged. 
Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  
Each Subordinated Note will be redeemed on the maturity date for its Outstanding Principal Amount unless we have previously 
conducted a Subordinated Note Repurchase or Subordinated Note Redemption or Exchanged or Written Down the 
Subordinated Notes in full. 
APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase 
A Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase may only occur before the maturity date if APRA has given 
its prior written approval to the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. Approval is at the discretion 
of APRA. Holders of Subordinated Notes should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for a Subordinated Note 
Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. 
Additionally, we may only conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase before the maturity date 
if either:  
 
before or concurrently with the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase we replace the 
Subordinated Notes with a capital instrument which is of the same or better quality (for the purposes of APRAs 
prudential standards as they are applied to the CBA Group at the relevant time) than the Subordinated Notes and the 
replacement of the Subordinated Notes is done under conditions that are sustainable for the income capacity of CBA; 
or 
 
we obtain confirmation from APRA that APRA is satisfied, having regard to the capital position of the CBA Level 1 
Group and the CBA Level 2 Group, that we do not have to replace the Subordinated Notes.  
Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be redeemed at the option of a holder of such Subordinated Note. 
As described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase, 
we may redeem prior to the maturity date in whole but not in part, the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note 
Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events, as described below.  
Any Subordinated Note Redemption as described below under Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of 
certain tax events and Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events will be made at 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, which shall be equal to 100% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes redeemed pursuant to the Subordinated Note Redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but 
excluding) the Subordinated Note Redemption Date. If we have provided a notice of Subordinated Note Redemption, the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes called for Subordinated Note Redemption shall become due on the 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
58 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Subordinated Note Redemption Date. On and after the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, unless we default in payment of 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, interest shall cease to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes. 
If we elect to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption, we will provide holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agent 
with at least 20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business Days) irrevocable notice (for the avoidance of doubt, an 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption). Notices of a 
Subordinated Note Redemption shall be given by us in writing and for so long as any Subordinated Notes are held by the 
Depositary, given to each holder in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Depositary relating to the delivery of 
notices, or mailed to their last addresses appearing on the register of the Subordinated Notes. Notices of a Subordinated Note 
Redemption shall specify the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, the place 
or places of payment and that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Notes which are the 
subject of the Subordinated Note Redemption.  
All Subordinated Notes which are the subject of a Subordinated Note Redemption will be cancelled forthwith and all our 
liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged.  
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events  
Subject to the requirements described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we receive an opinion from reputable legal counsel or other 
tax adviser in Australia, experienced in such matters, to the effect that there is a material risk that as a result of a change in laws 
of Australia (including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment which has been or will be 
introduced), we would be exposed to a more than de minimis adverse tax consequence in relation to the Subordinated Notes 
other than a tax consequence we expected as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected as at the date 
of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Tax Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of the Subordinated 
Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date. 
If we choose to redeem the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a 
Tax Event, then immediately prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption of Subordinated Notes pursuant 
to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated 
Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right 
to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which we would be subject to the adverse tax consequence. Such notice 
shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred and state that we have 
elected to exercise our option to conduct the Subordinated Note Redemption in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated 
Notes. 
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we determine that as a result of a change in the laws of 
Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards (including following any announcement of a prospective change or 
amendment which has been or will be introduced) all, some or a percentage of all or some Subordinated Notes are not or will 
not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the CBA Group under APRAs prudential standards (as amended from time to time), other 
than as a result of a change of treatment expected by us as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected 
as at the date of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Regulatory Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of 
the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date.  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
59 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If we choose to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a Regulatory Event, then immediately 
prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption pursuant to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent 
an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable 
detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have 
occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which all, some or a percentage of all or some of the Subordinated Notes 
will cease to be treated as Tier 2 Capital. Such notice shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note 
Redemption have occurred and state that we have elected to exercise our option to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption 
in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Notes. 
Subordinated Note Repurchase 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, we or any member of the CBA Group may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and 
regulations, at any time purchase Subordinated Notes in the open market, by tender to all or some of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or by private agreement or otherwise at any price (Subordinated Note Repurchase). All Subordinated 
Notes repurchased by us or any member of the CBA Group as a result of a Subordinated Note Repurchase will be cancelled 
forthwith and all our liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged. 
Mergers and similar transactions 
We are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another person. We are also permitted to sell substantially all of our 
assets to another person, or to buy substantially all of the assets of another person.  
However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met: 
 
where we merge out of existence or sell our assets, except as otherwise indicated below, the other person must be an 
entity organized as a corporation, trust or partnership, it must expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of and interest, if any, on the Subordinated Notes and the performance of every 
covenant included in the Subordinated Notes; 
 
we deliver to the holders of the Subordinated Notes an officers certificate and opinion of counsel, each stating that 
the consolidation, merger, sale, lease or purchase of assets complies with the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not cause a default on the Subordinated Notes, and we must not 
already be in default under the Subordinated Notes, unless the merger or other transaction would cure the default. 
If such person is not organized and validly existing under the laws of Australia, it must expressly agree: 
 
to indemnify the holder of the Subordinated Notes against any tax, assessment or governmental charge required to be 
withheld or deducted from any payment to such holder as a consequence of such merger, sale of assets or other 
transaction, provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any deduction or withholding imposed or 
required pursuant to Section 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official 
interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or 
regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code, and shall not require the payment of additional 
amounts on account of any such withholding or deduction); and 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
60 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
that all payments pursuant to the Subordinated Notes must be made without withholding or deduction for or on 
account of any tax of whatever nature imposed or levied on behalf of the jurisdiction of organization of such person, 
or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such tax is required by such jurisdiction or any 
such subdivision or authority to be withheld or deducted, in which case such person will pay such additional amounts 
in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Subordinated Notes after such withholding or deduction 
will equal the amount which would have been received in respect of the Subordinated Notes in the absence of such 
withholding or deduction, subject to the same exceptions as would apply with respect to the payment by us of 
additional amounts in respect of the Subordinated Notes (substituting the jurisdiction of organization of such person 
for Australia). 
Upon any such consolidation or merger, or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Issuer 
substantially as an entirety in accordance with the provisions described in this Mergers and similar transactions section 
above, the successor person formed by such consolidation or into which we are merged or to which such conveyance, transfer 
or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, us under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes with the same effect as if the successor person had been named as the Issuer therein 
and herein and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor person shall be relieved of all obligations and 
covenants under the Subordinated Notes and under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the above, the terms of the Subordinated Notes do not prevent us from consolidating with or merging into any 
other person or conveying, transferring or leasing our respective properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any 
person, or from permitting any person to consolidate with or merge into us or to convey, transfer or lease our respective 
properties and assets substantially as an entirety to us where such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease is: 
 
required by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) under law and prudential regulation 
applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia (including, without limitation, the Australian Banking Act or the 
Australian FSBT Act, as used herein, and any amendments thereto, rules thereunder and any successor laws, 
amendments and rules); or  
 
determined by us or by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) to be necessary in order for 
us to be managed in a sound and prudent manner or for us or APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official 
appointed by it) to resolve any financial difficulties affecting us, in each case in accordance with law and prudential 
regulation applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia. 
It is possible that the merger, sale of assets or other transaction would cause some of our property to become subject to a 
mortgage or other legal mechanism giving lenders preferential rights in that property over other lenders or over our general 
creditors if we fail to pay them back.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Payment of additional amounts  
We will pay all amounts that we are required to pay on the Subordinated Notes without withholding or deduction for, or on 
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed or levied by or on behalf of 
Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. This obligation will not apply, however, if those taxes, 
duties, assessments or other governmental charges are required by Australia or any such subdivision or taxing authority to be 
withheld or deducted (including withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in section 1471(b) of 
the Code). If that were to occur, we will pay additional amounts of, or in respect of, the principal of, and any premium and 
interest on, the affected Subordinated Notes (additional amounts) that are necessary so that the net amounts paid to the 
holders of those Subordinated Notes, after deduction or withholding, will equal the amounts of principal and any premium and 
interest that we would have had to pay on those Subordinated Notes if the deduction or withholding had not been required 
except that our obligation to pay additional amounts in relation to the Subordinated Notes will not apply to: 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed 
but for the fact that the holder of the affected Subordinated Note: 
 
was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment 
or was physically present in, Australia or otherwise had some connection with Australia other than only 
owning that Subordinated Note, or receiving payments under that Subordinated Note; 
 
presented that Subordinated Note for payment in Australia, unless he or she was required to present that 
Subordinated Note for payment and it could not have been presented for payment anywhere else; or 
 
presented that Subordinated Note more than 30 days after the date payment became due on that 
Subordinated Note or was provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have 
been entitled to the additional amounts on presenting the Subordinated Note for payment on any day during 
that 30 day period;  
 
any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge 
or any withholding or deduction on account of those taxes; 
 
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from 
payments of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on the affected Subordinated Note; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
holder or the beneficial owner of the affected Subordinated Note did not comply with our request: 
 
to provide information concerning his or her nationality, residence or identity; or 
 
to make a declaration or other similar claim or satisfy any requirement for information or reporting, 
which, in the case of each of the two preceding bullet points, is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or 
administrative practice of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in Australia as a condition to an 
exemption from all or part of the withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
person who receives the payment is our associate as defined in section 128F of the Australian Tax Act; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duties, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by 
reason of the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia giving a notice under Section 255 of the 
Australian Tax Act or Section 260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 of the Commonwealth of 
Australia; 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
62 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
any withholding or deduction due to a determination having been made under Part IVA of the Australian Tax Act (or 
any modification thereof or provision substituted therefor) by the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of 
Australia that withholding tax is payable in respect of a payment in circumstances where that payment would not have 
been subject to withholding tax because of a scheme which had the dominant purpose of causing the payment not to 
be subject to withholding tax;  
 
any withholding or deduction that is imposed by reason of the failure of a person entitled to such payment to perfect 
an exemption from any withholding or deduction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of any payment 
being made through an intermediary that is subject to withholding or deduction) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 
through 1474 of the Code and any regulations or agreements thereunder or official interpretations thereof; or 
 
any combination of the foregoing bullet points.  
The term associate is widely defined for the purposes of section 128F of the Australian Tax Act. It would include: 
 
a person who controls a majority voting interest in us or is able to sufficiently influence us; 
 
any trust under which we, or any of our subsidiaries, can benefit; and 
 
any entity which we can sufficiently influence or in which we have a majority voting interest, even where that entity 
acts as trustee. 
No additional amounts shall be payable with respect to any payment of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of, 
or any interest on, any Subordinated Note to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner 
of such payment to the extent that payment would, under the laws of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of 
Australia, be treated as being derived or received for tax purposes by a beneficiary or settlor of that fiduciary or a member of 
that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to those additional amounts had it been the actual 
holder of the affected Subordinated Note. 
In addition, any amounts to be paid on the Subordinated Notes will be paid, and any Ordinary Shares to be delivered as a result 
of an Exchange of such Subordinated Notes will be delivered, net of any deduction, withholding, interest or penalty imposed or 
required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official interpretations 
thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or 
practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such 
Sections of the Code (a FATCA Withholding), and no additional amounts will be required to be paid and no additional Ordinary 
Shares will be required to be delivered on account of any such FATCA Withholding. Each holder shall be deemed to authorize us 
to remit, or otherwise deal with, any amounts and Ordinary Shares comprising a FATCA Withholding and report information in 
accordance with applicable requirements connected therewith. 
Whenever we refer in this document, in any context, to the payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on any 
Subordinated Note or the net proceeds received on the sale or Exchange of any Subordinated Note, we mean to include the 
payment of additional amounts to the extent that, in that context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable. 
Any additional amounts payable on Subordinated Notes will be subordinated in right of payment, see  Status of Subordinated 
Notes above. 
Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange 
We may, without the consent of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, provided that the Substitution Conditions (as defined 
below) are satisfied, by giving notice to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and holders of the Subordinated Notes, substitute for 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
63 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
ourself a non-operating holding company within the meaning of the Australian Banking Act (NOHC) as the issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (Successor). 
The notice shall specify the date on which the substitution is to take effect (the Date of Substitution).  
Substitution Conditions 
The Substitution Conditions are: 
 
by entering into a deed poll and such other documents (if any) as may be necessary to give full effect to the 
substitution (the Successor Documents), the Successor agrees with effect on and from the Date of Substitution, to 
deliver NOHC Ordinary Shares under all circumstances when we would otherwise have been required to deliver 
Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms and conditions as set out in the Subordinated Notes (with all necessary 
modifications);  
 
unless otherwise approved by APRA in writing, the Successor agrees that in all circumstances where the Successor 
delivers fully paid NOHC Ordinary Shares under the Successor Documents, the Successor or another entity (which is a 
parent entity) will simultaneously subscribe for Ordinary Shares in such amount as may be necessary to ensure that 
the capital position of our Level 1 Group and our Level 2 Group is equivalent to the position if such Successor 
Documents had not been entered into and we were required to issue the Ordinary Shares; 
 
the NOHC Ordinary Shares are or are to be quoted on ASX, and the Successor agrees to use all reasonable endeavours 
and furnish all such documents, information and undertakings as may be reasonably necessary in order to procure 
quotation of NOHC Ordinary Shares issued under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes on the securities 
exchanges on which the NOHC Ordinary Shares are quoted at the time of delivery; 
 
both we and the Successor have obtained APRA approval and all other necessary authorizations, regulatory and 
governmental approvals and consents for such substitution and for the performance by the Successor of its obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes and the documents effecting substitution; 
 
if the Successor does not have a place of business in New York, the Successor has appointed a process agent in New 
York to receive service of process on its behalf in relation to any legal proceedings arising out of or in connection with 
the Subordinated Notes;  
 
the Successor has, in our reasonable opinion, the financial capacity to satisfy its obligations under the Subordinated 
Notes;  
 
we have used all reasonable endeavours to give an irrevocable notice to the holders of the Subordinated Notes as 
soon as practicable before the Board initiates a restructure of the CBA Group and a NOHC becomes our ultimate 
holding company (a NOHC Event), but no later than 10 Business Days before the NOHC Event occurs, specifying the 
amendments to the Subordinated Notes which will be made under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes 
in connection with the substitution of a NOHC as the issuer of Ordinary Shares on Exchange and such amended terms 
will have effect on and from the date specified in the notice; and 
 
the Successor will not be deemed to be an investment company required to register under the U.S. Investment 
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Effect of substitution of Successor 
If the relevant requirements set out in Substitution Conditions have been completed, on and from the Date of Substitution: 
 
we (or any corporation which has previously assumed our obligations) will be released from any obligation we would 
otherwise have under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes to issue Ordinary Shares to holders of the 
Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; and 
 
references to Ordinary Shares in the Subordinated Notes (other than the reference contained in the first two bullets 
under Substitution Conditions and in the definitions of Issue Date VWAP and VWAP Period (to the extent the 
reference applies to Issue Date VWAP only)) and the Terms Agreement will be taken to be references to the NOHC 
Ordinary Shares.  
Default, remedies and waiver of default  
Subordinated Note events of default 
A Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes if: 
(A) 
we fail to pay any amount due in respect of the Subordinated Notes and such default continues for a period of 15 
Business Days and is continuing, provided that no Subordinated Note Event of Default shall arise on account of any 
non-payment if we withhold, deduct or refuse to make the payment:  
 
in order to comply with any law or regulation or with the order of any court of competent jurisdiction, in 
each case applicable to such payment; or 
 
in case of doubt as to the validity or applicability of any such law, regulation or order, in accordance with 
advice given as to such validity or applicability, at any time during the said period of 15 Business Days, by 
independent legal advisers;  
 
to the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would not be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the Holder of Subordinated Notes); or 
(B) 
an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order successfully appealed or permanently 
stayed within 30 Business Days), or an effective resolution is passed, for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not 
elsewhere).  
Consequences of a Subordinated Note Event of Default 
If a Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes: 
 
as described under paragraph (A) of Subordinated Note events of default above, any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may institute proceedings: 
 
to recover the amount we have failed to pay, provided that we may only be compelled to pay that amount to 
the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the holder of the Subordinated 
Notes); 
 
for specific performance of any other obligation in respect of the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not elsewhere); or 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
65 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
as described under paragraph (B) Subordinated Note events of default above, the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately due and payable for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid 
interest up to (but excluding) the date of commencement of our Winding-Up and any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may, subject to the provisions described in How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt, prove in our 
Winding-Up in respect of this amount. 
A holder of Subordinated Notes has no right to accelerate payment or exercise any other remedies (including any right to sue for 
damages) as a consequence of any Subordinated Note Event of Default other than as set out in this section.  
Modification of the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement and waiver of covenants  
The prior written approval of APRA is required to modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, or to give consents or waivers in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes or take other actions where such modification, amendment, supplement, consent, waiver or other action 
may affect the eligibility of the Subordinated Notes as Tier 2 Capital of CBA (including, for the avoidance of doubt, waivers of any 
of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as they affect the Subordinated Notes, or in the Subordinated Notes).  
If we are able to obtain APRAs prior written approval, there are three types of changes we can make to the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes and these changes might subject the holders to U.S. federal tax.  
Changes requiring each holders approval 
First, there are changes that cannot be made without the consent or the affirmative vote or approval of each holder affected by 
the change. Here is a list of those types of changes: 
 
change to due date for the payment of Outstanding Principal Amount of, or any installment of interest on any 
Subordinated Note; 
 
reduce the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated Note, the portion of any Outstanding Principal Amount 
that is payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the Subordinated Note, the interest rate or the Subordinated Note 
Early Redemption Amount, except as expressly provided in the terms of the Subordinated Notes; 
 
changes to the subordination provisions of a Subordinated Note in a manner adverse to the interests of any holder of 
the Subordinated Note; 
 
change the currency of any payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
change our obligation to pay additional amounts;  
 
change the place of payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes necessary to modify, amend or 
supplement the Fiscal Agency Agreement or the Subordinated Notes or to waive past defaults or future compliance; or 
 
reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes required to adopt a resolution or 
the required quorum at any meeting of holders of Subordinated Notes at which a resolution is adopted. 
Changes not requiring approval  
The second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the Subordinated Notes. We may, without the vote or 
consent or affirmative vote or approval of any holder of Subordinated Notes, amend the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, if we are of the opinion that such alteration is: (i) of a 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
66 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
formal, technical or minor nature; (ii) made to cure any ambiguity or correct any manifest error; (iii) necessary or expedient for 
the purposes of facilitating a substitution under the terms described in Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (including satisfying any requirement of APRA in connection with such a substitution); (iv) made 
to amend any date or time period stated, required or permitted in connection with any Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Exchange (including, without limitation, when the proceeds of a Subordinated Note Redemption are to be reinvested in a new 
security to be issued by us or a Related Body Corporate); (v) not materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated 
Notes as a whole (subject to the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval); or (vi) made to (subject to 
the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval) (x) alter the terms of any Subordinated Notes to align 
them with any Relevant Tier 2 Securities issued after the date of such Subordinated Notes; or (y) alter either or both of the 
definitions of Relevant Tier 1 Securities and Relevant Tier 2 Securities on account of the issue (after the date of issue of any 
Subordinated Notes) of capital instruments of the CBA Group, provided in each case of (vi)(x) and (vi)(y) such alteration is not 
materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated Notes as a whole.   
Changes requiring majority approval 
Any other change to the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, 
requires the following (in addition to the prior written approval of APRA):  
 
the written consent of the holders of at least 50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes 
affected by such change; or 
 
the adoption of a resolution at a meeting at which a quorum of holders of Subordinated Notes is present by at least 
50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes affected by such change represented at the 
meeting. 
The same 50% approval would be required for us to obtain a waiver of any of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement or 
the Subordinated Notes. Such covenants include the promises we make about merging, which we describe above under  
Mergers and similar transactions. If the holders approve a waiver of a covenant, we will not have to comply with it. 
If approved in accordance with the terms described in this section, then all holders of Subordinated Notes, including holders 
who did not provide their written consent or attend and vote at a relevant meeting and holders who voted in a manner contrary 
to the majority, will be bound by such change. 
The quorum at any meeting called to adopt a resolution will be persons holding or representing a majority in Outstanding 
Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes and, at any reconvened meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum, 25% of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes. For purposes of determining whether holders of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of Subordinated Notes required for any action or vote, or for any quorum, have taken the action or vote, or 
constitute a quorum, the Outstanding Principal Amount of any particular Subordinated Note may differ from its Outstanding 
Principal Amount at the maturity date but will not exceed its stated face amount upon original issuance. 
Unless otherwise indicated, we will be entitled to set any day as a record date for determining which holders of book-entry 
Subordinated Notes are entitled to make, take or give requests, demands, authorizations, directions, notices, consents, waivers 
or other action, or to vote on actions, authorized or permitted by the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. In 
addition, record dates for any book-entry Subordinated Note may be set in accordance with procedures established by the 
Depositary from time to time. Therefore, record dates for book-entry Subordinated Notes may differ from those for other 
Subordinated Notes. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how 
approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the Fiscal Agency Agreement or any Subordinated Notes or request a 
waiver.

Only outstanding Subordinated Notes are eligible 
Only holders of outstanding Subordinated Notes will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of Subordinated Notes. 
Also, we will count only outstanding Subordinated Notes in determining whether the various percentage requirements for 
taking action have been met. For these purposes, a Subordinated Note will not be outstanding: 
 
if it has been surrendered for cancellation;  
 
to the extent it has been Written Down; 
 
if we have called such Subordinated Note for a Subordinated Note Redemption or it has become due and payable at 
maturity or otherwise and we have deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or 
Subordinated Note Redemption;  
 
if it is in lieu of or in substitution for other Subordinated Notes that have been authenticated and delivered; 
 
if we are the direct or indirect owner; or  
 
if it has been Exchanged.  
Form, exchange and transfer of Subordinated Notes 
If any Subordinated Notes cease to be issued in registered global form, they will be issued:  
 
only in fully registered form;  
 
without interest coupons; and  
 
unless we indicate otherwise, in denominations of US$200,000 or integral multiple of US$1,000 in excess thereof. 
Holders may exchange their Subordinated Notes for Subordinated Notes of smaller denominations or combine them into fewer 
Subordinated Notes of larger denominations, as long as the total Outstanding Principal Amount is not changed.  
Holders may exchange or transfer their Subordinated Notes at the office of the Fiscal Agent. They may also replace lost, stolen, 
destroyed or mutilated Subordinated Notes at that office. We have appointed the Fiscal Agent to act as our agent for registering 
Subordinated Notes in the names of holders and transferring and replacing Subordinated Notes. We may appoint another entity 
to perform these functions or perform them ourselves. 
Holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their Subordinated Notes, but they may be required 
to pay for any tax or other governmental charge associated with the exchange or transfer. The transfer or exchange, and any 
replacement, will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holders proof of legal ownership. The transfer agent 
may require an indemnity before replacing any Subordinated Notes. 
We may appoint additional transfer agents or cancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. We may also approve a 
change in the office through which any transfer agent acts. 
If any Subordinated Notes are redeemable pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption and we redeem less than all those 
Subordinated Notes, we may block the transfer or exchange of those Subordinated Notes during the period beginning 15 days 
before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to 
prepare the mailing, and refuse to register transfers of or exchange any Subordinated Note selected for redemption, except that 
we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any Subordinated Note being partially 
redeemed. 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
68 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If a Subordinated Note is issued as a Global Note, only the Depositary  i.e., DTC  will be entitled to transfer and exchange the 
Subordinated Note as described in this subsection, since the Depositary will be the sole holder of the Subordinated Note. 
The rules for exchange described above apply to exchange of Subordinated Notes for other Subordinated Notes of the same 
kind.  
Payment mechanics for Subordinated Notes 
Who receives payment? 
If interest is due on a Subordinated Note on an interest payment date, we will pay the interest to the person in whose name the 
Subordinated Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date relating to the interest payment date, see 
 Payment of interest below. If interest is due at the maturity date, we will pay the interest to the person entitled to receive 
the principal of the Subordinated Note. If principal or another amount besides interest is due on a Subordinated Note at the 
maturity date, we will pay the amount to the holder of the Subordinated Note against surrender of the Subordinated Note at a 
proper place of payment or, in the case of a Global Note, in accordance with the applicable policies of the Depositary, which will 
be DTC. 
Payment of interest 
For each interest payment date, the interest to be paid in arrears to (but excluding) the interest payment date shall be that 
which has accrued from (and including) the prior interest payment date. Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year 
comprised of twelve 30-day calendar months. If any interest payment date for the Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a 
Business Day, the interest payment shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment 
shall accrue for the period from and after the interest payment date. If the maturity date or any earlier Redemption Date falls on 
a day that is not a Business Day, payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest otherwise due on such day will be 
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such 
maturity date, or Redemption Date, as the case may be. 
No interest will accrue on any Subordinated Notes, or relevant percentage of Subordinated Notes, required to be Exchanged in 
the period from (and including) the interest payment date that immediately precedes the Exchange Date or (in the case where 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down) the Write Down Date to the Exchange Date or Write Down Date, as applicable.   
How we will make payments on Global Notes  
We will make payments on a Global Note in accordance with the applicable policies as in effect from time to time of the 
Depositary, which will be DTC. Under those policies, we will pay directly to the Depositary, or its nominee, and not to any 
indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the Global Note. An indirect owners right to receive those payments will be 
governed by the rules and practices of the Depositary and its participants. 
Paying Agent 
We may appoint one or more financial institutions to act as our paying agents, at whose designated offices Subordinated Notes 
in non-global entry form may be surrendered for payment at their maturity. We call each of those financial institutions a Paying 
Agent. We may add, replace or terminate Paying Agents from time to time; provided that at all times there will be a Paying 
Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. We may also choose to act as our own Paying Agent. Initially, we 
have appointed The Bank of New York Mellon, as the Paying Agent. We must notify the Fiscal Agent of changes in the Paying 
Agents.  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
69 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Unclaimed payments 
Regardless of who acts as Paying Agent, all money paid by us to a Paying Agent that remains unclaimed at the end of two years 
after the amount is due to a holder will be repaid to us. After that two-year period, the holder may look only to us for payment 
and not to the Fiscal Agent, any other Paying Agent or anyone else. 
Notices 
Notices to be given to holders of a Global Note will be given only to the Depositary, in accordance with its applicable policies as 
in effect from time to time. Notices to be given to holders of Subordinated Notes not in global form will be sent by mail to the 
respective addresses of the holders as they appear in the Fiscal Agents records, and will be deemed given when mailed. Neither 
the failure to give any notice to a particular holder, nor any defect in a notice given to a particular holder, will affect the 
sufficiency of any notice given to another holder. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for 
information on how they will receive notices. 
Nothing in the above paragraph affects the Exchange or Write Down of the Subordinated Notes as described under  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  Exchange. 
Our relationship with the Fiscal Agent 
The Bank of New York Mellon is serving as the Fiscal Agent for the Subordinated Notes issued under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement. The Bank of New York Mellon has provided services for us and our affiliates in the past and may do so in the future. 
Among other things, The Bank of New York Mellon serves as fiscal agent with regard to some of our other debt obligations. 
Successor fiscal agent 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that the Fiscal Agent may be removed by us at any time or may resign upon 30 days prior 
written notice to us or any shorter period that we accept, effective upon the acceptance by a successor fiscal agent of its 
appointment. The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that any successor fiscal agent must have an established place of business 
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and a combined capital and surplus in excess of US$50,000,000. We must 
notify the holders of the Subordinated Notes of the appointment of a successor fiscal agent. 
Governing law 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us, the subordination 
provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Status and Subordination of Subordinated Notes above, the Exchange 
and Write Down provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the 
occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event above and the substitution provisions described above under Substitution of a 
NOHC for us as issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law 
applying in New South Wales, Australia. We have appointed the General Manager, Americas, of our New York branch, located at 
599 Lexington Avenue, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10022, as our agent for service of process in The City of New York in 
connection with any action arising out of the sale of the Subordinated Notes or enforcement of the terms of the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement.

Schedule 2  Rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares may be issued to a holder of Subordinated Notes by way of Exchange. Ordinary Shares may also be 
issued to a nominee to hold for sale for the benefit of a holder of Subordinated Notes if Exchange occurs and the 
holder of Subordinated Notes has notified CBA that they do not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or the holder of 
Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder. 
The rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares are set out in the constitution of CBA, which is dated 13 
November 2008, and incorporates amendments up to and including all amendments passed at the Annual General 
Meeting on 13 November 2008 (Constitution). The Constitution provides for the following: 
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Any Ordinary Shares issued to a holder of Subordinated Notes by way of Exchange will be fully paid and will rank 
equally with Ordinary Shares already on issue in all respects. 
Transfers 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, transfers of Ordinary Shares are not effective until registered. 
Ordinary Shares are transferable, subject to the ASX Listing Rules, ASX Settlement Operating Rules and the 
Constitution, and the right of the directors of CBA to refuse to register a transfer of Ordinary Shares in limited 
circumstances. 
Unless otherwise required by law or the Constitution, CBA is entitled to treat the registered holder as the absolute 
owner of a share. Ordinary Shares held by a trustee may, with the directors consent, be identified as being subject to 
the relevant trust. 
Except in limited circumstances, CBA is not bound to register more than three persons as joint holders of an Ordinary 
Share. If CBA is required to issue a share certificate for a share by law or the ASX Listing Rules, CBA is not required 
to issue more than one certificate. 
Restrictions apply in respect of persons who become entitled to Ordinary Shares by reason of a holders death or 
bankruptcy. In the case of the death of a holder, the survivor or survivors jointly registered as holders and the legal 
personal representatives of a sole holder are the only persons CBA will recognise as having title to the holders 
interest in the shares. 
Dividends 
Holders of Ordinary Shares may receive dividends if the directors determine that a dividend is payable. CBA may not 
pay a dividend unless CBAs assets exceed its liabilities, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the 
shareholders of CBA as a whole and the payment does not materially prejudice the ability of CBA to pay its creditors. 
Payment may also be subject to the rights of holders of securities carrying preferred rights. CBA pays holders with 
registered addresses in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom cash dividends by direct credit. If a direct 
credit payment instruction is not provided, the dividend will be held in a non-interest bearing account. CBA also has a 
dividend reinvestment plan for eligible holders. The directors of CBA determine whether or not the dividend 
reinvestment plan operates for each dividend and their decision is announced to ASX. 
Winding up 
On winding up of CBA, holders of Ordinary Shares will participate in the division of any surplus assets of CBA (subject 
to the rights of holders of shares carrying preferred rights).

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Meetings 
Holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive notice of, attend and, subject to the Constitution, to vote in person, 
by representative, attorney or proxy at general meetings of CBA. 
On a show of hands, each holder (regardless of the number of shares held) has one vote. On a poll, each holder has 
one vote for each fully paid Ordinary Share held. 
Issue of further shares 
The directors of CBA control the issue of shares. Subject to the Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rules, the directors 
may issue further shares, and grant rights or options over shares, on such terms as they think fit. 
Restrictions of ownership of Ordinary Shares

right of persons to hold, own or vote on Ordinary Shares. 
Variation of the Constitution

by members entitled to vote on the resolution) to vary the Constitution.

lodged with ASX on 12 September 2019. If approved, the amendments are not expected to impact materially the 
rights attaching to Ordinary Shares described above.

ASX announcement 
ISSUE OF AUD 100 MILLION WORTH OF 
SUBORDINATED NOTES 
Notice under section 708A(12H)(e) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) 
23 September 2019: Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is pleased to confirm that today it will issue AUD 100 
million worth of subordinated notes. The AUD 100 million 3.66 percent subordinated notes due 2034 (Subordinated 
Notes) will be issued pursuant to CBAs U.S.$70,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme (EMTN 
Programme). Terms used but not defined in this announcement are defined in the information memorandum for the 
issue of the Subordinated Notes under the EMTN Programme dated 3 July 2019 (Information Memorandum). 
The Subordinated Notes potentially exchange into fully paid ordinary shares of CBA (Ordinary Shares) if a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs. 
This notice is a cleansing notice prepared for the purposes of section 708A(12H)(e) of the Corporations Act 2001 
(Cth) (Corporations Act) (as inserted by ASIC Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71). 
CBA has elected to give this notice to enable Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange to be sold without disclosure 
under Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act. This notice includes all the information investors and their professional 
advisers would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of: 
 
in Schedule 1, the rights and liabilities attaching to the Subordinated Notes that is based on the description in 
the Information Memorandum, as supplemented by the pricing supplement for the Subordinated Notes dated 
19 September 2019 (Pricing Supplement); and 
 
in Schedule 2, the rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares, 
in each case only to the extent to which it is reasonable for investors and their professional advisers to expect to find 
the information in this notice. 
CBA confirms that: 
(a) 
the Subordinated Notes were issued without disclosure to investors under Part 6D.2 of the Corporations Act; 
(b) 
the information in this notice remains current as at todays date; 
(c) 
this notice (including the schedules) complies with section 708A of the Corporations Act, as modified by ASIC 
Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71; and 
(d) 
this notice (including the schedules) has complied with section 708A(12I) of the Corporations Act as inserted 
by ASIC Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71. 
Effect of the Subordinated Notes offer on CBA 
The issue of Subordinated Notes by CBA will not have a material impact on CBAs financial position. If a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event occurs and CBA issues Ordinary Shares, the impact of Exchange on CBA would be to increase CBAs 
shareholders equity. The number of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange is limited to the Maximum Exchange 
1 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019

Number. The Maximum Exchange Number is 31,351.89 Ordinary Shares per Subordinated Note (with a nominal 
value of A$500,000), based on the Issue Date VWAP of A$79.74 per Ordinary Share.  
Additional information 
CBA is a disclosing entity for the purposes of the Corporations Act and, as a result, is subject to regular reporting and 
disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act and the ASX Listing Rules. In addition, CBA must notify ASX 
immediately (subject to certain exceptions) if it becomes aware of information about CBA that a reasonable person 
would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of its securities including Ordinary Shares.

ISIN: 
XS2055108349 
Form: 
Each Subordinated Note will be: 
 
denominated in Australian dollars; 
 
registered on a register located in Luxembourg (Register); 
 
a debt obligation of the Issuer;  
 
subject to the relevant Conditions (set out in the Information Memorandum) 
Title: 
Entry of the name of the person in the Register in respect of a Subordinated Note 
constitutes or passes title to the Subordinated Note and is conclusive evidence of 
3 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
that person's entitlements to receive interest and repayment of principal in the 
manner provided for in the Conditions 
Denomination: 
Subordinated Notes will be issued in a specified denomination of AUD 500,000 
Clearing System: 
The Subordinated Notes will initially be represented by a global note in registered 
form (a Registered Global Note). Registered Global Notes will be deposited with a 
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and will be 
registered in the name of its nominee. Persons holding beneficial interests in 
Registered Global Notes will be entitled or required, as the case may be, under the 
circumstances described below, to receive physical delivery of definitive 
Subordinated Notes. 
Interests in a Registered Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge), in whole 
but not in part, for definitive Subordinated Notes without receipts, interest coupons 
or talons attached only upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event. The Issuer will 
promptly give notice to Subordinated Holders in accordance with the Conditions if an 
Exchange Event occurs. In the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event, 
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any person acting on their behalf 
(acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such Registered Global 
Note) may give notice to the Registrar requesting exchange. Any such exchange 
shall occur not later than 10 days after the date of receipt of the first relevant notice 
by the Registrar. 
For so long as any of the Subordinated Notes are represented by a Registered 
Global Note held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each 
person (other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) who is for the time being 
shown in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of 
a particular nominal amount of such Subordinated Notes (in which regard any 
certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to 
the nominal amount of such Subordinated Notes standing to the account of any 
person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest 
error) shall be treated by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and any Transfer Agent as 
the holder of such nominal amount of Subordinated Notes for all purposes other 
than with respect to payments on the Subordinated Notes for which purpose the 
registered holder of the relevant Registered Global Note shall be treated by the 
Issuer and any Paying Agent as the holder of such Subordinated Notes in 
accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Subordinated Global Note 
and the terms Subordinated Holder and holder of Subordinated Notes and 
related expressions shall be construed accordingly. 
For these purposes, Exchange Event means that (i) the Issuer has been notified 
that both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business 
for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or 
otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have 
in fact done so and no successor clearing system is available or (ii) the Issuer has or 
will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were 
the Subordinated Notes represented by the Registered Global Note to be in 
definitive form.

Payments: 
Payments of principal, interest and any other amount in respect of the Registered 
Global Notes will, in the absence of provision to the contrary, be made to the person 
shown on the Register as the registered holder of the Registered Global Notes. 
None of the Issuer, any Paying Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or 
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments or deliveries made on 
account of beneficial ownership interests in the Registered Global Notes or for 
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial 
ownership interests. 
Payment in respect of Subordinated Notes held in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, 
Luxembourg and which are represented by a Registered Global Note will only be 
made in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being of Euroclear 
and Clearstream, Luxembourg as the case may be. 
Payments of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of the definitive 
Subordinated Notes will, in the absence of provision to the contrary, be made to the 
persons shown on the Register at the close of business on the fifteenth day 
immediately preceding the due date for payment. 
Transfer: 
Subordinated Notes can only be transferred in accordance with the Conditions. 
Subordinated Notes held in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and which 
are represented by a Global Note will only be transferable in accordance with the 
rules and procedures for the time being of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg 
as the case may be. 
Taxes: 
All payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer will 
be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future 
taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (Taxes) 
imposed or levied by or on behalf of Australia unless such Taxes are required by law 
to be withheld or deducted. 
Where any withholding or deduction is required by law, the Issuer must pay such 
additional amounts to the Subordinated Holders that will result in those 
Subordinated Holders receiving the amounts they would have received had no such 
withholding or deduction been required, except that no additional amounts will be 
payable with respect to any Subordinated Note: 
 
if the Subordinated Holder is subject to such Taxes by reason of its being 
connected with the Commonwealth of Australia other than by reason only 
of the holding of the Subordinated Note or the receipt of payment on the 
Subordinated Note; 
 
if the Subordinated Holder is an associate (as that term is defined in the 
Australian Tax Act) of the Issuer and the payment being sought is not, or 
will not be, exempt from interest withholding tax because of section 128F(6) 
of the Australian Tax Act; 
 
presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except 
5 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
to the extent that the Subordinated Holder would have been entitled to 
such additional amounts on presenting such Subordinated Note for 
payment on the last day of such period of 30 days; 
 
if the Subordinated Holder could lawfully avoid (but has not so avoided) 
such deduction or withholding by complying with any statutory 
requirements in force at the present time or in the future or by making a 
declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption; or 
 
for, or on account of any withholding or deduction required pursuant to 
FATCA (defined below). 
FATCA: Holders may be 
subject to FATCA 
withholding and 
information reporting: 
Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
commonly known as FATCA, a foreign financial institution (as defined by FATCA) 
may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (foreign passthru 
payments) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting or related 
requirements. The Issuer is classified as a foreign financial institution. 
A number of jurisdictions (including Australia) have entered into, or have agreed in 
substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement 
FATCA (IGAs), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. 
Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an 
IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA 
from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA 
provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Subordinated Notes, including 
whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with 
respect to payments on instruments such as the Subordinated Notes, are uncertain 
and may be subject to change.  Even if withholding would be required pursuant to 
FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the 
Subordinated Notes, such withholding would not apply prior the date that is two 
years after the date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments 
are filed with the U.S. Federal Register and any Subordinated Notes issued on or 
prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining 
foreign passthru payments are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would 
be grandfathered for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified 
after such date (including by reason of a substitution of the issuer).  However, if 
additional Subordinated Notes that are not distinguishable from previously issued 
Subordinated Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and 
are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all 
Subordinated Notes, including the Subordinated Notes offered prior to the expiration 
of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA.  Holders 
should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their 
investment in the Subordinated Notes. In the event any withholding would be 
required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the 
Subordinated Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a 
result of the withholding. 
The impact of FATCA for Australian financial institutions will also depend on 
associated guidance issued by the Australian Taxation Office. Prospective investors 
should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to 
6 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019

payments they may receive in connection with the Subordinated Notes. 
Governing law: 
English law (except for Conditions 3(b), 14(b), 21 and 22 relating to subordination, 
substitution and Exchange or Write-Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Event, which will be governed by and construed in accordance with New South 
Wales law) 
Listing: 
Application will be made to the ASX for the Subordinated Notes to be quoted on the 
ASX 
Issue Price: 
100 per cent of the Aggregate Nominal Amount 
Status and ranking: 
Subordinated Notes will be direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the 
Issuer and rank in a winding-up: 
 
after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims 
preferred by applicable laws; 
 
equally among themselves and with claims in respect of Equal Ranking 
Securities; and 
 
ahead of all claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims 
referred to in sections 563AA and 563A of the Corporations Act. 
Senior Ranking Obligations means all present and future deposits and other 
liabilities, securities and other obligations of the Issuer which would be entitled to be 
admitted in the winding up of the Issuer (and including but not limited to obligations 
in respect of instruments issued before 1 January 2013 as Tier 2 Capital) other than 
Equal Ranking Securities and Junior Ranking Securities. 
Equal Ranking Securities means any instrument that ranks in a winding up of the 
Issuer as the most junior claim in the winding up of the Issuer ranking senior to 
Junior Ranking Securities, and includes: 
(a) 
if on issue at the commencement of the winding up of the Issuer, the 
JPY20,000,000,000 Perpetual Subordinated Callable Fixed/Floating Rate 
Reverse Dual Currency Securities issued by the Issuer in 1999; and 
(b) 
any other instruments, present and future, issued after 1 January 2013 as 
instruments constituting Tier 2 Capital. 
Junior Ranking Securities means: 
(a) 
any instrument, present and future, issued by the Issuer which qualifies as 
Tier 1 Capital or, in the case of any instrument issued prior to 1 January 
2013, was treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in accordance with the 
prudential standards which applied prior to 1 January 2013, irrespective of 
whether or not such instrument is treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in 
7 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
accordance with any transitional arrangements provided by APRA or which 
rank or are expressed to rank equally with such securities in a winding up of 
the Issuer; and 
(b) 
all Ordinary Shares of the Issuer. 
The applicable laws which give priority to certain claims include (but are not limited 
to) sections 13A and 16 of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) (Banking Act) and section 
86 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth). These provisions provide that, in the event 
that the Issuer becomes unable to meet its obligations or suspends payment, its 
assets in Australia are to be available to meet its liabilities to, among others, APRA, 
the Reserve Bank of Australia and holders of protected accounts held in Australia, in 
priority to all other liabilities, including the Subordinated Notes. 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. 
The Subordinated Notes are not protected accounts or deposit liabilities of the 
Issuer for the purposes of the Banking Act. 
Maturity Date: 
23 September 2034 
Events of Default: 
An event of default (Event of Default) broadly occurs if: 
(a) 
the Issuer fails to pay any amount due in respect of the Subordinated Notes 
and such default continues for a period of 15 Business Days and is 
continuing (except where the non-payment is in compliance with law or 
legal advice or to the extent that, immediately after the payment, the Issuer 
will not be Solvent (in which case such amount still accumulates and 
remains a debt owing to the Noteholder by the Issuer)); or 
(b) 
an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order 
successfully appealed or permanently stayed within 30 Business Days), or 
an effective resolution is passed, for the winding up of the Issuer in 
Australia (but not elsewhere). 
If an Event of Default occurs as described in paragraph (a), any Subordinated 
Holder may institute proceedings: 
 
to recover the amount the Issuer has failed to pay, provided that the Issuer 
may only be compelled to pay that amount to the extent that, immediately 
after the payment, the Issuer will be Solvent (in which case such amount 
still accumulates and remains a debt owing to the Noteholder by the 
Issuer); 
 
for specific performance of any other obligation in respect of the 
Subordinated Note; or 
 
for the winding up of the Issuer in Australia (but not elsewhere). 
If an Event of Default occurs as described in paragraph (b), a Subordinated Holder 
may prove in the winding up of the Issuer in respect of an amount equal to the 
8 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid Interest up to (but excluding) 
the date of commencement of the winding up. 
There are no other Events of Default, and a Subordinated Holder has no right to 
accelerate payment or exercise any other remedy (including any right to sue for 
damages) as a consequence of any Event of Default other than in the circumstances 
described above. 
A winding-up will not occur solely by reason of (i) an application to wind up being 
made or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, administrator or official with similar 
powers under section 13A(1) of the Banking Act. 
Interest: 
The interest rate will be a fixed rate of 3.60 per cent. per annum.  
Interest is payable annually in arrear on 23 September in each year, commencing on 
23 September 2020 up to and including the Maturity Date. 
A Subordinated Note bears interest on its Outstanding Principal Amount, subject to 
the Conditions. 
No interest accrues on Subordinated Notes, or the relevant percentage of 
Subordinated Notes, required to be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares in the period 
from (and including) the Interest Payment Date that immediately precedes the Non-
Viability Trigger Event to the Subordinated Note Exchange Date or Write Down Date 
(as applicable). 
Redemption or 
Repurchase: 
Each Subordinated Note will be Redeemed on the Maturity Date for its Final 
Redemption Amount unless previously Redeemed, Exchanged or Written Down in 
full. 
The Issuer may elect to Redeem all or some Subordinated Notes on the Optional 
Redemption Date in accordance with the Conditions. This option is not exercisable 
before the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date of the Subordinated Notes. 
In certain circumstances following notice by the Issuer, the Issuer may Redeem all 
(but not some) of the Subordinated Notes if there is a material risk that, as a result of 
a change in laws of Australia (including following any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or will be introduced) the Issuer 
would be exposed to a more than de minimis adverse tax consequence in relation to 
the Subordinated Notes other than a tax consequence the Issuer expected as at the 
Issue Date. 
In certain circumstances following notice by the Issuer, the Issuer may Redeem all 
(but not some) of the Subordinated Notes if it determines that as a result of a 
change in the laws of Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards 
(including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment 
which has been or will be introduced) all or some or a percentage of the 
Subordinated Notes are not or will not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the Group 
under APRAs prudential standards (as amended from time to time), other than as a 
9 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
result of a change of treatment expected by the Issuer as at the Issue Date. 
The Issuer or any member of the Group may, to the extent permitted by applicable 
laws and regulations, at any time purchase the Subordinated Notes in the open 
market, by tender to all or some of the Subordinated Holders or by private 
agreement or otherwise at any price. 
Early Redemption or Repurchase of the Subordinated Notes is subject to the prior 
written approval of APRA. 
Subordinated Holders should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for any 
early Redemption or Repurchase of Subordinated Notes. 
No Set-Off: 
None of the Issuer, any Subordinated Holder or any person claiming through any of 
them has any right of set-off in respect of any amounts owed by one person to the 
other person. 
Non-Viability Trigger 
Event: 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies the Issuer in writing that 
it believes: 
(i) 
an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write 
down of capital instruments of the Group, is necessary because, without it, 
the Issuer would become non-viable; or 
(ii) 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary 
because, without it, the Issuer would become non-viable. 
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital instruments which must be 
Exchanged, Written Down, converted or written down (as applicable). 
Exchange or Write Down 
on the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger 
Event: 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer must Exchange in accordance 
with the Conditions such number of Subordinated Notes (or, if it so determines, such 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) as is 
equal (taking into account any conversion or write down of other Relevant 
Securities) to the aggregate face value of capital instruments which APRA has 
notified the Issuer must be Exchanged, converted or written down (or, if APRA has 
not so notified the Issuer, such number or, if the Issuer so determines, such 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, as is 
necessary to satisfy APRA that the Issuer will no longer be non-viable). If a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs in circumstances where APRA believes a public sector 
injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, without it, the 
Issuer would become non-viable, the Issuer must Exchange all Subordinated Notes. 
In determining the number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, which must be Exchanged, the Issuer 
will: 
(i) 
first, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 1

permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange 
of the Subordinated Notes; 
(ii) 
secondly, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant 
Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to 
require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before 
Exchange of the Subordinated Notes; and 
(iii) 
thirdly, if exchange, conversion or write down of those securities is not 
sufficient, Exchange (in the case of the Subordinated Notes) or exchange, 
convert or write down (in the case of any other Relevant Tier 2 Securities) 
on a pro-rata basis or in a manner that is otherwise, in the opinion of the 
Issuer, fair and reasonable, the Subordinated Notes and any other Relevant 
Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to 
require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down in that 
manner (subject to such adjustments as the Issuer may determine to take 
into account the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of 
Ordinary Shares and any Subordinated Notes or other Relevant Tier 2 
Securities remaining on issue), 
 
but such determination will not impede the immediate Exchange of the relevant 
number of Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount 
of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be). 
Subordinated Holders should note that the Issuer has no obligation to issue or keep 
on issue any Relevant Tier 1 Securities or Relevant Tier 2 Securities. 
 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred and all or some of the Subordinated 
Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note) are required to be Exchanged, then: 
(a) 
Exchange of the relevant Subordinated Notes or percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note will occur 
immediately upon the date of occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event; 
and 
(b) 
the entry of the corresponding Subordinated Note in each relevant 
Subordinated Holders holding in the Register will constitute an entitlement 
of that Subordinated Holder (or of the nominee) to the relevant number of 
Ordinary Shares (and if applicable, also to any remaining balance of the 
Subordinated Notes or remaining percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Note). 
If, for any reason, Exchange of any Subordinated Note (or a percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated Note) required to be Exchanged 
fails to take effect and the Issuer has not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares 
required to be issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business Days after 
the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the relevant 
Subordinated Holders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and Interest and the right to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such 
11 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes are immediately and irrevocably terminated (Written Down) 
and such termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the 
Non Viability Trigger Event.  The Issuer must give notice as soon as practicable that 
Write Down has occurred to the Registrar and the Subordinated Holders, and the 
notice must specify the date on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred. 
Exchange Mechanics: 
On the Subordinated Note Exchange Date, the Issuer will allot and issue the 
Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares for each Subordinated Note (or percentage of 
the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) required to be 
Exchanged. The Exchange Number is, subject always to the Exchange Number 
being no greater than the Maximum Exchange Number, calculated according to the 
following formula: 
where: 
P means 0.99. 
VWAP (expressed in Australian dollars and cents) means, broadly, the average 
daily volume weighted prices of Ordinary Shares traded on ASX during the relevant 
VWAP Period. 
VWAP Period means: 
(a) 
in the case of the calculation of the Exchange Number, the period of five 
Ordinary Shares Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took 
place immediately preceding (but not including) the Subordinated Note 
Exchange Date; or 
(b) 
in the case of the Issue Date VWAP, the period of 20 Ordinary Shares 
Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took place immediately 
preceding but excluding the Issue Date. 
Maximum Exchange Number means a number calculated according to the 
following formula: 
Maximum 
Exchange 
Number 
= 
Outstanding Principal Amount  
0.20 x Issue Date VWAP 
The Issue Date VWAP (and accordingly the Maximum Exchange Number) is subject 
to limited adjustments for bonus issues and certain capital reconstructions. 
If the Subordinated Notes of a Subordinated Holder are required to be Exchanged 
Exchange Number = 
Outstanding Principal Amount  
P x VWAP 
12 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
and: 
 
the Subordinated Holder has notified the Issuer that it does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares as a result of Exchange, which notice may be 
given at any time on or after the Issue Date and prior to the Subordinated 
Note Exchange Date; 
 
the Subordinated Holder is, broadly, restricted by applicable Australian law 
from holding Ordinary Shares or is considered by the Issuer not to be a 
resident of Australia; or 
 
the Issuer has not received (for any reason whether or not due to the fault 
of that Subordinated Holder) any information required by it so as to impede 
the Issuer issuing the Ordinary Shares, 
then, subject to the Conditions, on the Subordinated Note Exchange Date, the 
Subordinated Holders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such 
Subordinated Notes being Exchanged are immediately and irrevocably terminated 
and the Issuer will (subject to the Conditions) issue the Exchange Number of 
Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee may not be the Issuer or a Related 
Entity of the Issuer) for no additional consideration on terms that, at the first 
opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares, the nominee will arrange for their sale at 
market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the relevant Subordinated 
Holder. 
Investment Risks: 
This paragraph does not describe all the risks in investing in Subordinated Notes. 
Prospective investors or purchasers should consult their own financial and legal 
advisers about risks associated with an investment in the Subordinated Notes and 
the suitability of investing in the Subordinated Notes in light of their particular 
circumstances. 
Neither the current nor the historical value of euros, commodities, interest rates or 
other indices or formulae should be taken as an indication of future performance of 
euros, commodities, interest rates or other indices or formulae during the term of 
any Subordinated Notes. 
Additional Non-Viability 
Trigger Event Risk: 
Without in any way limiting the section above titled Investment Risks, certain 
additional risks arise in respect of the Subordinated Notes. 
As outlined in the sections above titled Non-Viability Trigger Event and Exchange 
or Write Down on the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event, Subordinated 
Notes are subject to a Non-Viability Trigger Event that could lead to Subordinated 
Notes being Exchanged or Written Down. 
It should be noted that whether a Non-Viability Trigger Event will occur is at the 
discretion of APRA and there are currently no precedents for this. The 
circumstances in which APRA may exercise its discretion are not limited to when 
APRA may have a concern about a banks capital levels but may also include when 
13 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
APRA has a concern about a banks funding and liquidity levels. 
If one, or a combination, of general risks associated with the Issuers businesses 
leads to a significant capital loss, or prolonged difficulties in raising funding or 
maintaining sufficient liquidity, the Issuer believes this may be the type of situation in 
which APRA becomes concerned and notifies the Issuer that it has become non-
viable. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer must immediately Exchange such 
number of the Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) as specified by APRA or necessary to satisfy 
APRA that the Issuer will no longer be non-viable. In the case of a public sector 
injection of capital, or equivalent support, all Subordinated Notes must be 
Exchanged. The Exchange will be irrevocable. 
If Subordinated Notes are Exchanged following the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, the number of Ordinary Shares received is limited to the Maximum 
Exchange Number. There is a risk that Subordinated Holders will receive a number 
of Ordinary Shares with a value significantly less than the Outstanding Principal 
Amount. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs and Exchange is not effective and the Issuer 
is not otherwise able to issue Ordinary Shares within five Business Days, then 
Subordinated Holders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and Interest and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to Subordinated 
Notes being Exchanged are immediately and irrevocably terminated. Subordinated 
Holders investment will lose all of its value, the Outstanding Principal Amount will 
not be repaid and Subordinated Holders will not receive any compensation. 
If Subordinated Notes are Exchanged following the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, sale of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange may be restricted by 
applicable Australian law, including if the Issuer has not issued the disclosure 
required by the Corporations Act for the new Ordinary Shares, then restrictions 
apply on the sale of the new Ordinary Shares to certain investors within 12 months 
of their issue.  However, these restrictions will not apply if CBA makes certain 
compliant disclosures at the time when the Subordinated Notes are issued. 
Subordinated Holders may receive Ordinary Shares on Exchange. The rights and 
liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares are set out in the Constitution and are also 
regulated by the Corporations Act, ASX Listing Rules and other applicable laws. 
Amendments: 
The Issuer may amend the Conditions: 
 
without the consent of Subordinated Holders, as set out in the Conditions, 
including if the amendment is of a formal, technical or minor nature; made 
to cure any ambiguity or correct any manifest error or not materially 
prejudicial to the interests of Subordinated Holders; or to enable the 
substitution of a NOHC as the issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange 
provided certain substitution conditions are satisfied; and 
 
with the consent of Holders, by an Extraordinary Resolution being passed 
14 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019

at a duly convened meeting. 
Certain amendments may require prior written approval from APRA. Approval is at 
the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given.

Schedule 2  Rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares may be issued to Subordinated Holders by way of Exchange. Ordinary Shares may also be issued to 
a nominee to hold for sale for the benefit of a Subordinated Holder if Exchange occurs and the Subordinated Holder 
has notified CBA that they do not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or the Subordinated Holder is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder. 
The rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares are set out in the constitution of CBA, which is dated 13 
November 2008, and incorporates amendments up to and including all amendments passed at the Annual General 
Meeting on 13 November 2008 (Constitution). The Constitution provides for the following: 
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Any Ordinary Shares issued to Subordinated Holders by way of Exchange will be fully paid and will rank equally with 
Ordinary Shares already on issue in all respects. 
Transfers 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, transfers of Ordinary Shares are not effective until registered. 
Ordinary Shares are transferable, subject to the ASX Listing Rules, ASX Settlement Operating Rules and the 
Constitution, and the right of the directors of CBA to refuse to register a transfer of Ordinary Shares in limited 
circumstances. 
Unless otherwise required by law or the Constitution, CBA is entitled to treat the registered holder as the absolute 
owner of a share. Ordinary Shares held by a trustee may, with the directors consent, be identified as being subject to 
the relevant trust. 
Except in limited circumstances, CBA is not bound to register more than three persons as joint holders of an Ordinary 
Share. If CBA is required to issue a share certificate for a share by law or the ASX Listing Rules, CBA is not required 
to issue more than one certificate. 
Restrictions apply in respect of persons who become entitled to Ordinary Shares by reason of a holders death or 
bankruptcy. In the case of the death of a holder, the survivor or survivors jointly registered as holders and the legal 
personal representatives of a sole holder are the only persons CBA will recognise as having title to the holders 
interest in the shares. 
Dividends 
Holders of Ordinary Shares may receive dividends if the directors determine that a dividend is payable. CBA may not 
pay a dividend unless CBAs assets exceed its liabilities, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the 
shareholders of CBA as a whole and the payment does not materially prejudice the ability of CBA to pay its creditors. 
Payment may also be subject to the rights of holders of securities carrying preferred rights. CBA pays holders with 
registered addresses in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom cash dividends by direct credit. If a direct 
credit payment instruction is not provided, the dividend will be held in a non-interest bearing account. CBA also has a 
dividend reinvestment plan for eligible holders. The directors of CBA determine whether or not the dividend 
reinvestment plan operates for each dividend and their decision is announced to ASX. 
Winding up 
On winding up of CBA, holders of Ordinary Shares will participate in the division of any surplus assets of CBA (subject 
to the rights of holders of shares carrying preferred rights).

Meetings 
Holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive notice of, attend and, subject to the Constitution, to vote in person, 
by representative, attorney or proxy at general meetings of CBA. 
On a show of hands, each holder (regardless of the number of shares held) has one vote. On a poll, each holder has 
one vote for each fully paid Ordinary Share held. 
Issue of further shares 
The directors of CBA control the issue of shares. Subject to the Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rules, the directors 
may issue further shares, and grant rights or options over shares, on such terms as they think fit. 
Restrictions of ownership of Ordinary Shares 
Australian laws including financial sector and foreign ownership and takeover laws impose certain limitations on the 
right of persons to hold, own or vote on Ordinary Shares. 
Variation of the Constitution 
CBA may seek approval by special resolution of holders of Ordinary Shares (passed by at least 75% of the votes cast 
by members entitled to vote on the resolution) to vary the Constitution. 
CBA is seeking shareholder approval for amendments to the Constitution, as explained in CBAs Notice of Meeting 
lodged with ASX on 12 September 2019. If approved, the amendments are not expected to materially impact the 
rights attaching to Ordinary Shares described above.

Dear Martin, 
 
For dissemination to the market: 
 
CBA Instalments (STWIYE and STWIYF series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in SPDR S&P/ASX 200 FUND (STW) with ASX Codes STWIYE and STWIYF, 
declared the record date for entitlements to the estimated $0.838779, 0% franked dividend for the 
STW Commonwealth Bank Instalments to be 30 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for 
the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 27 September 2019. Again, this 
coincides with the ex-dividend date for the STW ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of STW Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from STW on 11 October 
2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the consolidation. You should review further information 
from http://www.spdrs.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual 
circumstances.  
 
Should you have any queries, please contact your financial adviser or call CommSec on 13 15 20

Consolidation of 0.9710 per existing share. The shares will quote ex on 30 September 2019. The 
record date is 1 October 2019. 
 
Instalment Warrant Adjustments 
CBA Equity Products Group will apply the combined cash proceeds of the Capital Return of $0.39

INFORMATION MEMORANDUM FOR THE ISSUE OF EXEMPT NOTES 
THIS INFORMATION MEMORANDUM HAS BEEN PREPARED BY THE ISSUER IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE ISSUE OF EXEMPT NOTES UNDER THE PROGRAMME WHICH ARE NEITHER TO BE 
ADMITTED TO TRADING ON A REGULATED MARKET IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA 
NOR OFFERED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A 
PROSPECTUS IS REQUIRED TO BE PUBLISHED UNDER THE PROSPECTUS DIRECTIVE (AS 
DEFINED BELOW). 
NEITHER THE ISSUER NOR ANY DEALER HAS AUTHORISED, NOR DO THEY AUTHORISE, THE 
MAKING OF ANY OFFER OF EXEMPT NOTES IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH AN OBLIGATION 
ARISES FOR THE ISSUER OR ANY DEALER TO PUBLISH OR SUPPLEMENT A PROSPECTUS FOR 
SUCH OFFER. 
THIS INFORMATION MEMORANDUM HAS NOT BEEN REVIEWED OR APPROVED BY THE 
FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY AS COMPETENT AUTHORITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, 
NOR HAS IT BEEN REVIEWED OR APPROVED BY ANY COMPETENT AUTHORITY IN ANY 
OTHER MEMBER STATE OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE 
A PROSPECTUS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROSPECTUS DIRECTIVE. 
 
Incorporated in Australia with limited liability 
U.S.$70,000,000,000* 
Euro Medium Term Note Programme 
*Combined programme limit for the Euro Medium Term Note Programme of ASB Finance Limited and Commonwealth Bank of 
Australia. This Information Memorandum relates to Exempt Notes to be issued under such programme by Commonwealth Bank of 
Australia only. 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the "Issuer" or the "Bank") may from time to time issue Euro Medium Term 
Notes under this U.S.$70,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the "Programme") for which no 
prospectus is required to be published (the "Exempt Notes") under Directive 2003/71/EC, as amended or 
superseded (the "Prospectus Directive").  The Exempt Notes may be issued in any form contemplated in 
"Conditions of the Exempt Notes" herein and as described in "Overview of the Programme" herein. 
The Exempt Notes will be issued from time to time to one or more of the Dealers specified on page 8 (each a 
"Dealer" and together the "Dealers", which expression shall include any additional Dealers appointed under the 
Programme (as defined below) from time to time). References in this Information Memorandum to the "relevant 
Dealer" shall, in the case of an issue of Exempt Notes being (or intended to be) subscribed by more than one 
Dealer, be to all Dealers agreeing to subscribe for such Exempt Notes. The Issuer may agree with any Dealer that 
Exempt Notes may be issued in a form not contemplated by the "Conditions of the Exempt Notes" herein.  
In the case of Subordinated Notes, in the event of the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event (as 
defined in Condition 21(a)), the Issuer must exchange all or some of the Subordinated Notes or a percentage 
of the outstanding principal amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be and in an amount as 
determined pursuant to Condition 21(a)) for ordinary shares in the capital of the Issuer ("Ordinary 
Shares"). If for any reason, an exchange pursuant to Condition 21(a) fails to take effect and the Issuer has 
not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in respect of such exchange within five 
Ordinary Shares Business Days (as defined in Condition 22(m)) after the occurrence of the Non-Viability 
Trigger Event then the relevant Noteholders rights (including to payment of the then outstanding principal 
amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes or percentage 
of the then outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated Notes are immediately and irrevocably 
terminated ("Written Down", and "Write Down" has a corresponding meaning) and such termination will 
be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event.  
See Condition 21.  
Words and expressions used but not defined in this Information Memorandum shall have the same meaning as 
ascribed to them in "Form of the Exempt Notes" and "Conditions of the Exempt Notes". 
An investment in Exempt Notes issued under the Programme involves certain risks. For a discussion of these 
risks see "Risk Factors".  
Notice of the aggregate nominal amount of, interest (if any) payable in respect of, the issue price of, and any other 
terms and conditions not contained herein which are applicable to, each Tranche of Exempt Notes will be set out in 
a pricing supplement (the "Pricing Supplement") copies of which will be available for viewing during normal 
business hours at the registered office of the Issuer at Ground Floor, Tower 1, 201 Sussex Street, Sydney, NSW, 
Australia, 2000 and the specified office set out herein of each of the Paying Agents (as defined below). 
The Issuer has been rated AA- by Standard & Poors (Australia) Pty. Ltd. ("S&P"), Aa3 by Moodys Investors 
Service Pty Ltd. ("Moodys") and AA- by Fitch Australia Pty Ltd ("Fitch"). 
Any Exempt Notes issued under the Programme may be rated or unrated by any one or more of the rating agencies 
referred to above.  Where a Tranche of Exempt Notes is rated, such rating will be disclosed in the Pricing 
For personal use only

Supplement and will not necessarily be the same as the rating assigned to the Issuer by the relevant rating agency.  
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension, 
reduction or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. 
Application may be made to the Australian Securities Exchange (the "ASX") for Exempt Notes issued under the 
Programme to be quoted on the ASX. 
Amounts payable on Floating Rate Notes and Fixed Reset Notes may be calculated by reference to one of LIBOR, 
EURIBOR or SONIA as specified in the relevant Pricing Supplement. As at the date of this Information 
Memorandum, (i) the administrator of LIBOR, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, is included in ESMA's 
register of administrators under Article 36 of Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011 (the "Benchmarks Regulation"); and 
(ii) each of the administrator of EURIBOR, European Money Markets Institute, and the administrator of SONIA, 
The Bank of England, are not included in ESMA's register of administrators under the Benchmarks Regulation. As 
far as the Issuer is aware, (i) the transitional provisions in Article 51 of the Benchmarks Regulation apply, such that 
the administrator of EURIBOR, European Money Markets Institute, is not currently required to obtain 
authorisation or registration; and (ii) under Article 2 of the Benchmarks Regulation, the Bank of England is not 
required to obtain authorisation or registration. 
The registration status of any administrator under the Benchmarks Regulation is a matter of public record and, save 
where required by applicable law, the Issuer does not intend to update any Pricing Supplement to reflect any 
change in the registration status of the administrator. 
This document is issued in replacement of an Information Memorandum dated 3 July 2018 and accordingly 
supersedes that earlier Information Memorandum. This does not affect any Exempt Notes issued under the 
Programme prior to the date of this Information Memorandum.

The Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Information Memorandum.  To 
the best of the knowledge of the Issuer (which has taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the 
case) the information contained in this Information Memorandum, is in accordance with the facts and 
does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information. 
This Information Memorandum is to be read in conjunction with all documents which are deemed to be 
incorporated in it by reference (see "Documents Incorporated by Reference"). This Information 
Memorandum shall, save as specified herein, be read and construed on the basis that those documents 
are so incorporated and form part of this Information Memorandum. 
The Dealers (which term in this paragraph and the third paragraph below includes Commonwealth 
Bank of Australia in its capacity as a dealer but does not include Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 
its capacity as issuer of the Exempt Notes) have not separately verified the information contained 
herein. Accordingly, no representation, warranty or undertaking, express or implied, is made and no 
responsibility or liability is accepted by the Dealers as to the accuracy or completeness of the 
information contained in this Information Memorandum or any further information supplied by the 
Issuer in connection with the Exempt Notes. 
No person has been authorised to give any information or to make any representation not contained in 
this Information Memorandum or any further information supplied in connection with the Programme 
or the Exempt Notes and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon 
as having been authorised by the Issuer or any of the Dealers. 
Neither this Information Memorandum nor any further information supplied in connection with the 
Programme or any Exempt Notes is intended to provide the basis of any credit or other evaluation and 
should not be considered as a recommendation by the Issuer or any of the Dealers that any recipient of 
this Information Memorandum or any further information supplied in connection with the Programme 
or the Exempt Notes should purchase any Exempt Notes. Each investor contemplating purchasing 
Exempt Notes should make its own independent investigation of the condition and affairs, and its own 
appraisal of the creditworthiness, of the Issuer. Neither this Information Memorandum nor any further 
information supplied in connection with the Programme or the Exempt Notes constitutes an offer or 
invitation by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of the Dealers to any person to subscribe for or to 
purchase any Exempt Notes. 
The delivery of this Information Memorandum does not at any time imply that the information 
contained in it concerning the Issuer is correct at any time subsequent to its date or that any further 
information supplied in connection with the Programme or the Exempt Notes is correct as of any time 
subsequent to the date indicated in the document containing the same. The Dealers expressly do not 
undertake to review the financial or other condition or affairs of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries 
during the life of the Programme. Investors should review, inter alia, the most recent financial 
statements of the Issuer when deciding whether or not to purchase any Exempt Notes. 
The distribution of this Information Memorandum and the offer or sale of the Exempt Notes may be 
restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. Persons into whose possession this Information Memorandum 
or any Exempt Notes come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions. In 
particular, there are restrictions on the distribution of this Information Memorandum and the offer or 
sale of the Exempt Notes in the United States of America, the European Economic Area (the EEA) 
(including the United Kingdom and Luxembourg), Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the 
PRC, Macau (each as defined below), the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (see "Subscription 
and Sale"). 
In the United Kingdom, this document is being distributed only to, and is directed only at, investors (i) 
who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the "Order") 
or who fall within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, and (ii) to whom it may otherwise lawfully be 
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as "Relevant Persons"). This document must 
not be acted on or relied on in the United Kingdom by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any 
For personal use only
 
4 
investment or investment activity to which this communication relates is available only to Relevant 
Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons. 
The Exempt Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (the "Securities Act") or any U.S. State securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the 
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S under the 
Securities Act unless an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available 
and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of any state of the United States and any other 
jurisdiction (see "Subscription and Sale"). 
This Information Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Exempt Notes in any 
Member State of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member 
State") will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as implemented in that 
Relevant Member State, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Exempt Notes.  
Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer of Exempt Notes in that Relevant 
Member State may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any 
Dealer to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a 
prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer.  
Neither the Issuer nor any Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of 
Exempt Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any Dealer to publish or 
supplement a prospectus for such offer. 
Any reference herein to an agreement between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer shall, in the case of 
Exempt Notes being, or intended to be, subscribed by more than one Dealer, be to an agreement 
between such Issuer and all such Dealers. 
IMPORTANT  EEA RETAIL INVESTORS  The Exempt Notes are not intended to be offered, 
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any 
retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: 
(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, MiFID 
II); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended or superseded), where 
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of 
MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive. Consequently no key 
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the PRIIPs 
Regulation) for offering or selling the Exempt Notes or otherwise making them available to retail 
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Exempt Notes or otherwise 
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. 
MiFID II product governance/target market  The Pricing Supplement in respect of any Exempt 
Notes may include a legend entitled "MiFID II Product Governance" which will outline the target 
market assessment in respect of the Exempt Notes and which channels for distribution of the Exempt 
Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Exempt Notes (a 
distributor) should take into consideration the target market assessment; however, a distributor 
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the 
Exempt Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate 
distribution channels. 
A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the Product 
Governance rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the MiFID Product Governance Rules), 
any Dealer subscribing for any Exempt Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Exempt Notes, but 
otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a 
manufacturer for the purpose of the MiFID Product Governance Rules. 
Product Classification pursuant to Section 309B of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289 
of Singapore)  In connection with Section 309B of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of 
Singapore (as amended, the SFA) and the Securities and Futures (Capital Markets Products) 
Regulations 2018 of Singapore (the CMP Regulations 2018), unless otherwise stated in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement, all Exempt Notes shall be prescribed capital markets products (as defined in the 
Securities and Futures (Capital Markets Products) Regulations 2018) and Excluded Investment 
For personal use only
 
5 
Products (as defined in the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the MAS) Notice SFA 04-N12: Notice 
on the Sale of Investment Products and in the MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on Recommendations on 
Investment Products). 
The Exempt Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the 
Exempt Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In 
particular, each potential investor may wish to consider, either on its own or with the help of its 
financial and other professional advisers, whether it: 
(i) 
has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Exempt 
Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Exempt Notes and the information contained or 
incorporated by reference in this Information Memorandum or any applicable supplement; 
(ii) 
has access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its 
particular financial situation, an investment in the Exempt Notes and the impact the Exempt 
Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio; 
(iii) 
has sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the 
Exempt Notes, including Exempt Notes with principal or interest payable in one or more 
currencies, or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the 
potential investors currency; 
(iv) 
understands thoroughly the terms of the Exempt Notes and is familiar with the behaviour of 
any relevant indices and financial markets; and 
(v) 
is able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may 
affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks. 
Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments. The investment activities of certain 
investors are subject to investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. 
Each potential investor should determine whether and to what extent (1) Exempt Notes are legal 
investments for it, (2) Exempt Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing and (3) 
other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Exempt Notes. Financial institutions should 
consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of 
Exempt Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

AUSTRALIAN BANKING LEGISLATION 
The Issuer is an authorised deposit-taking institution (an "ADI") for the purposes of the Banking Act 
1959 of Australia (the "Banking Act"). The Banking Act provides that, in the event an ADI becomes 
unable to meet its obligations or suspends payment, the ADIs assets in Australia are available to meet 
specified liabilities of the ADI in priority to all other liabilities of the ADI (including, in the case of the 
Issuer, any Exempt Notes issued under the Programme). These specified liabilities include certain 
obligations of the ADI to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ("APRA") in respect of 
amounts payable by APRA to holders of protected accounts, other liabilities of the ADI in Australia in 
relation to protected accounts, debts to the Reserve Bank of Australia (the RBA) and certain other 
debts to APRA. A "protected account" is, subject to certain conditions including as to currency and 
unless prescribed otherwise by regulations, an account or a specified financial product: (a) where the 
ADI is required to pay the account-holder, on demand or at an agreed time, the net credit balance of the 
account, or (b) otherwise prescribed by regulation. The Australian Treasurer has published a declaration 
of products prescribed as protected accounts for the purposes of the Banking Act. Changes to applicable 
law may extend the liabilities required to be preferred by law. 
Any Exempt Notes issued under the Programme will not represent a protected account of, or a deposit 
with, the Issuer. The liabilities which are preferred by law to the claim of a holder of an Exempt Note 
issued under the Programme will be substantial and the Conditions of the Exempt Notes do not limit the 
amount of such liabilities which may be incurred or assumed by the Issuer from time to time. 
The offer or sale of any Exempt Notes under the Programme will not require disclosure under Part 6D.2 
or Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act 2001 of Australia (the Corporations Act) as the Issuer is an ADI 
under the Banking Act and section 708(19) of the Corporations Act provides that an offer of an ADIs 
debentures for issue or sale does not need such disclosure. Accordingly, this Information Memorandum 
has not been, nor will be, lodged with nor registered by the Australian Securities and Investments 
Commission (ASIC). 
STABILISATION 
In connection with the issue of any Tranche of Exempt Notes, one or more relevant Dealers (the 
Stabilisation Manager(s)) (or persons acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) may, 
outside of Australia and on a financial market operated outside of Australia, over-allot Notes or 
effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than 
that which might otherwise prevail. However stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any 
stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the 
terms of the offer of the relevant Tranche of Exempt Notes is made and, if begun, may cease at 
any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the relevant 
Tranche of Exempt Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the relevant Tranche of 
Exempt Notes. Any stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the relevant 
Stabilisation Manager(s) (or persons acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) in 
accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

deduction is made, the Issuer will, save in certain limited circumstances 
provided in Condition 9, be required to pay such additional amounts in 
respect of the Exempt Notes as will result (after withholding or deduction 
of the Taxes) in payment to the holders of the Exempt Notes of the 
amounts which would have been payable had there been no such 
withholding or deduction. 
Status of Unsubordinated 
Notes: 
Unsubordinated 
Notes 
will 
constitute 
direct, 
unconditional, 
unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will rank 
equally among themselves and equally with the Issuers other unsecured 
and unsubordinated obligations (except for certain debts that are required 
to be preferred by applicable laws) subject as provided in Condition 3(a).

Events of Default for Unsubordinated Notes are set out in Condition 
11(a). There is no cross default or negative pledge. 
Status of Subordinated 
Notes: 
Subordinated Notes will constitute direct and subordinated obligations of 
the Issuer and will rank in the winding up of the Issuer (a) after the 
claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims 
preferred by applicable laws, (b) equally among themselves and with 
claims in respect of Equal Ranking Securities and (c) ahead of all claims 
in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims referred to in

provided in Condition 3(b). 
Non-Viability Trigger 
Event in respect of 
Subordinated Notes: 
In the case of Subordinated Notes, in the event of the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event, the Issuer must exchange all or some of the 
Subordinated Notes or a percentage of the outstanding principal amount 
For personal use only
 
10 
of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be and in an amount as 
determined pursuant to Condition 21(a)) for Ordinary Shares. If for any 
reason, an exchange pursuant to Condition 21(a) fails to take effect and 
the Issuer has not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be 
issued in respect of such exchange within five Ordinary Shares Business 
Days after the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event then the 
relevant Noteholders rights (including to payment of the then 
outstanding principal amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary 
Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes or percentage of the then 
outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated Notes are immediately 
and irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have 
occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability 
Trigger Event.  See Condition 21. 
Substitution in respect of 
Subordinated Notes: 
In the case of Subordinated Notes, the Issuer may substitute for itself a 
"non-operating holding company" within the meaning of the Banking Act 
("NOHC") as the issuer of ordinary shares on Exchange or, if so 
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, as the debtor in respect of 
the Subordinated Notes. If a NOHC is substituted as the debtor in respect 
of the Subordinated Notes it means that a holder of Subordinated Notes 
would no longer have rights against the Issuer. If a NOHC is substituted 
as the issuer of ordinary shares on Exchange it means that a holder of 
Subordinated Notes will receive ordinary shares in the NOHC rather than 
the Issuer. 
Events of Default for 
Subordinated Notes: 
Events of Default for Subordinated Notes are set out in Condition 11(b). 
There is no cross default or negative pledge. 
Fixed Rate Notes: 
Fixed interest will be payable in arrear on such date or dates in each year 
as may be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer and on 
redemption and will be calculated on the basis of such Day Count 
Fraction as may be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer. 
Fixed Reset Notes: 
Fixed Reset Notes will initially bear interest at the Initial Interest Rate 
until (but excluding) the Reset Date. On the Reset Date, the interest rate 
will be reset to the rate per annum equal to the aggregate of the 
applicable Reset Reference Rate and the Margin as determined by the 
Principal Paying Agent on the relevant Reset Determination Date.  
Floating Rate Notes: 
Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate determined on the same 
basis as the floating rate under a notional interest rate swap transaction in 
the relevant Specified Currency governed by an agreement incorporating 
the 2006 ISDA Definitions, published by the International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association, Inc. and as amended and updated as at the Issue 
Date of the first Tranche of the Exempt Notes, or on the basis of a 
reference rate appearing on an agreed screen page of a commercial 
quotation service or on such other basis as may be specified in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement. 
 
The Margin (if any) relating to such floating rate will be specified in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement. 
Index Linked Notes: 
Payments of principal in respect of Index Linked Redemption Notes or of 
interest in respect of Index Linked Interest Notes will be calculated by 
reference to such index and/or formula or formulae as the Issuer and the 
relevant Dealer may agree. Only Unsubordinated Notes may be Index 
Linked Notes. 
Other provisions in 
Floating Rate Notes (except where such Notes are Subordinated Notes) 
For personal use only
 
11 
relation to Floating Rate 
Notes and Index Linked 
Interest Notes: 
and Index Linked Interest Notes may also have a maximum interest rate, 
a minimum interest rate or both. 
Interest on Floating Rate Notes and Index Linked Interest Notes will be 
payable on Interest Payment Dates, as agreed at the time of agreement to 
issue, and (where applicable) will be calculated on the basis of the Day 
Count Fraction specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. 
 
Details of the interest rate applicable to the then current Interest Period in 
respect of the Floating Rate Notes or (where applicable) Index Linked 
Interest Notes of any Series will be available from the Principal Paying 
Agent. 
Dual Currency Notes: 
Payments (whether in respect of principal or interest and whether at 
maturity or otherwise) in respect of Dual Currency Notes will be made in 
such currencies, and based on such rates of exchange, as the Issuer and 
the relevant Dealer may agree. Only Unsubordinated Notes may be Dual 
Currency Notes. 
Zero Coupon Notes: 
Zero Coupon Notes will be offered and sold at par or at a discount to 
their nominal amount and will not bear interest. Only Unsubordinated 
Notes may be Zero Coupon Notes. 
Benchmark 
Discontinuation: 
In the case of Fixed Reset Notes, Floating Rate Notes and Index Linked 
Interest Notes, if the Issuer determines that a Benchmark Event has 
occurred, the relevant benchmark or screen rate may be replaced by a 
Successor Rate or, if there is no Successor Rate but the Issuer determines 
there is an Alternative Rate (acting in good faith and by reference to such 
sources as it deems appropriate, which may include consultation with an 
Independent Adviser), such Alternative Rate. An Adjustment Spread may 
also be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case 
may be), together with any Benchmark Amendments (which in the case 
of any Alternative Rate, any Adjustment Spread unless formally 
recommended or provided for and any Benchmark Amendments shall be 
determined by the Issuer, acting in good faith and by reference to such 
sources as it deems appropriate, which may include consultation with an 
Independent Adviser). For further information, see Condition 5(f). 
Redemption of 
Unsubordinated Notes: 
The applicable Pricing Supplement will indicate either that the Exempt 
Notes of that Tranche cannot be redeemed prior to their stated maturity, 
other than in specified instalments or for taxation reasons, or that such 
Exempt Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Issuer (in specified 
amounts if the applicable Pricing Supplement so indicate) and/or at the 
option of the holder(s) of such Exempt Notes on a date or dates specified 
prior to such stated maturity and at a price or prices and on such other 
terms as may be indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement. 
 
The applicable Pricing Supplement may provide that Exempt Notes may 
be redeemed in two or more instalments and on such dates and on such 
other terms as may be indicated in such Pricing Supplement. 
 
Exempt Notes having a maturity of less than one year from the date of 
issue may be subject to restrictions on their denomination and 
distribution, see "Certain Restrictions  Notes having a maturity of less 
than one year" above. 
Redemption of 
Subordinated Notes: 
The applicable Pricing Supplement will indicate whether any 
Subordinated Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Issuer on any 
Optional Redemption Date. Any redemption of Subordinated Notes on 
any Optional Redemption Date will be subject to the Issuer (i) either

replacing the Subordinated Notes with a capital instrument which is of 
the same or better quality than the Subordinated Notes under conditions 
that are sustainable for the income capacity of the Issuer or obtaining 
confirmation from APRA that it is satisfied, having regard to the capital 
position of the CBA Level 1 Group and CBA Level 2 Group, that the 
Issuer does not have to replace the Subordinated Notes and (ii) APRA 
having given its prior written approval to such redemption. Subordinated 
Notes may also be redeemed (in full and not in part), subject to the 
Conditions (including APRA having given prior written approval), at the 
option of the Issuer for certain taxation reasons (as set out under 
Condition 6(b)) or for certain regulatory reasons (as set out under 
Condition 6(c)), in each case at their then outstanding principal amount 
together with any accrued but unpaid interest as at the date fixed for 
redemption. The scheduled redemption of Subordinated Notes will 
otherwise be on the Maturity Date at their then outstanding principal 
amount unless exchanged or written down in full. For further 
information, see Condition 6. 
Listing: 
Application may be made to the ASX for Exempt Notes issued under the 
Programme to be quoted on the ASX. Exempt Notes may be listed, 
admitted to trading and/or quoted, as the case may be, by or on other or 
further listing authorities, stock exchanges, markets and/or quotation 
systems agreed between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer in relation to 
the Series.  Exempt Notes which are not listed, admitted to trading and/or 
quoted by or on any listing authority, stock exchange, market and/or 
quotation system may also be issued. 
 
The applicable Pricing Supplement will state whether or not the relevant 
Notes are to be listed and/or admitted to trading and/or quoted and, if so, 
by or on which listing authority(ies), stock exchange(s), markets and/or 
quotation systems. 
Governing Law: 
English law (except, in the case of Subordinated Notes, for the provisions 
of Conditions 3(b), 14(b), 21 and 22 relating to subordination, 
substitution and Exchange or Write-Down upon the occurrence of a Non-
Viability Trigger Event, which will be governed by New South Wales 
law).

Risk Factors 
In purchasing Exempt Notes, investors assume the risk that the Issuer may become insolvent or 
otherwise be unable to make all payments due in respect of the Exempt Notes.  There is a wide range of 
factors which individually or together could result in the Issuer becoming unable to make all payments 
due in respect of the Exempt Notes.  It is not possible to identify all such factors or to determine which 
factors are most likely to occur, as the Issuer may not be aware of all relevant factors and certain factors 
which it currently deems not to be material may become material as a result of the occurrence of events 
outside the Issuers control.  The Issuer has identified in this Information Memorandum a number of 
factors which could materially adversely affect its businesses and ability to make payments due under 
the Exempt Notes. 
In addition, factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with 
Exempt Notes issued by the Issuer under the Programme are also described below. 
Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Information 
Memorandum and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision. 
FACTORS RELATING TO THE ISSUER, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO FULFIL ITS 
OBLIGATIONS UNDER EXEMPT NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAMME 
The Issuer is subject to extensive regulation and operates in an environment of political scrutiny, 
which could adversely impact its operations and financial condition 
The Issuer and its businesses are subject to extensive regulation in Australia across multiple regulatory 
bodies as well as other regulators in jurisdictions in which the Issuer operates or obtains funding, 
including New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong 
and Indonesia.  
Key domestic regulators include APRA, ASIC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre 
(AUSTRAC), the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (the OAIC), the Australian 
Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, the RBA and 
the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). 
APRA as the Issuers prudential regulator in Australia has very wide powers under the Banking Act, 
including in limited circumstances to direct banks (including the Issuer) not to make payments on its 
debt and equity securities.  
In addition to its key Australian regulators, a range of international regulators and authorities supervise 
and regulate the Issuer in respect of, among other areas, capital adequacy, liquidity levels, funding, 
provisioning, insurances, compliance with prudential regulation and standards, accounting standards, 
remuneration, data access, stock exchange listing requirements, and the Issuers compliance with 
relevant financial crime, sanction, privacy, taxation, competition, consumer protection and securities 
trading laws.   
The Issuer and the wider financial services industry are facing increased regulation in many of these 
areas and jurisdictions and changes or new regulation in one part of the world could lead to changes 
elsewhere. 
Any change in law, regulation, accounting standards, policy or practice of regulators, or failure to 
comply with laws, regulation or policy, may adversely affect the Issuers business, financial condition, 
liquidity, operations, prospects and its reputation, and its ability to execute its strategy, either on a 
short-term or long-term basis. The potential impacts of regulatory change are wide, and could include 
increasing the levels and types of capital that the Issuer is required to hold and restricting the way the 
Issuer can conduct its business and the nature of that business, such as the types of products that it can 
offer to customers. 
The Issuer may also be adversely affected if the pace or extent of such regulatory change exceeds its 
ability to adapt to such changes and embed appropriate compliance processes adequately.  The pace of 
regulatory change means that the regulatory context in which the Issuer operates is often uncertain and 
complex.

Regulatory reforms 
Examples of significant regulatory reform under development in Australia include a review of Open 
Banking (as defined below), APRA's proposals to revise the capital framework for ADIs and the 
Treasury Laws Amendment (Design and Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention Powers) Act 
2019.  
In late 2017, the Australian Government announced it would legislate an economy-wide Consumer 
Data Right to give consumers access to and control over their data, beginning with banking (referred to 
as Open Banking). The Australian Government has decided to phase in Open Banking with the major 
banks expected to make data available on credit and debit card, deposit and transaction accounts from 
July 2019, before expanding to other banking products (e.g. mortgages) and sharing of consumer data 
between banks and accredited third parties (at the direction of the consumer). These reforms are 
intended to increase competition in the financial sector and improve customer outcomes. Consumer 
Data Right laws have not yet been passed by the Federal Parliament in Australia. Increased competition 
resulting from Open Banking may adversely impact the Issuers business and financial condition. 
The finalisation of the capital reforms, which is currently under consultation with APRA, may result in 
changes to the risk-weighting framework for certain asset classes, which are expected to increase the 
Issuers risk-weighted assets (RWA) and accordingly (all things being equal) reduce the Issuer's 
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. As part of the revisions to the capital framework, APRA is also 
consulting with the industry on approaches for achieving international comparability, without changing 
the quantum of CET1 capital. APRA is separately consulting on its proposed approach for loss-
absorbing capacity to support the orderly resolution of Australian ADIs. For Domestic Systemically 
Important Banks (D-SIBs) such as the Issuer, APRAs proposal would require an increase in the total 
capital requirement. See "Failure to maintain capital adequacy requirements would adversely affect the 
Issuers financial condition" for more information. 
The Treasury Laws Amendment (Design and Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention 
Powers) Act 2019 could impact the Issuers ability to issue and market financial products in the future. 
This law requires issuers of financial products to identify target markets for their products, select 
appropriate distribution channels, and periodically review arrangements to ensure they continue to be 
appropriate. In addition, distributors of financial products will be required to put in place reasonable 
controls to ensure products are distributed in accordance with the identified target markets. The Product 
Intervention Power will enable ASIC to intervene in the distribution of a financial product and a credit 
product where it perceives a risk of significant consumer detriment. Increased compliance costs 
resulting from financial product distribution requirements may adversely impact the Issuers business 
and financial condition. 
Outside Australia there have also been a series of other regulatory initiatives from authorities in the 
various jurisdictions in which the Issuer operates or obtains funding that would result in significant 
regulatory changes for financial institutions. Examples include proposals for changes to financial 
regulations in the United States (including legislation enacted in May 2018 that rolled back certain 
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-
Frank) and additional proposals to further dilute the law, including prohibitions that prevent banking 
entities from engaging in certain risk-prone proprietary trading activities or investments in hedge funds 
or private equity funds, known as the Volcker Rule), more data protection regulations in Europe and 
MiFID II in Europe. Authorities in Europe and the United Kingdom may also propose significant 
regulatory changes as a result of Brexit, however the scope and timing of any such changes remains 
uncertain. There may be an extended period of increased uncertainty and volatility in the global 
financial markets while the details of Brexit are negotiated. See "The Issuer may be adversely affected 
by general business and economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets" for more 
information.  
In the United States, the Issuer elected to be treated as a Financial Holding Company by the Federal 
Reserve Board in the United States in October 2016. As a result, the Issuer is subject to additional 
regulatory requirements in the United States that it was not subject to prior to that election. 
Other regulatory and political developments 
For personal use only
 
15 
There is currently an environment of heightened scrutiny by the Australian Government and various 
Australian regulators on the Australian financial services industry. Examples of industry-wide scrutiny 
that may lead to future changes in laws, regulation or policies, include the establishment of a Royal 
Commission to inquire into the misconduct by financial service entities.  
The Royal Commission 
The Royal Commission was established on 14 December 2017 and was authorised to inquire into 
misconduct by financial service entities (including the Issuer). Seven rounds of hearings into 
misconduct in the banking and financial services industry were held throughout 2018, covering a 
variety of topics including consumer and business lending, financial advice, superannuation, insurance 
and a policy round. The Royal Commissions final report was delivered on 1 February 2019. The final 
report included 76 policy recommendations to the Australian Government and findings in relation to the 
case studies investigated during the hearings, with a number of referrals being made to regulators for 
misconduct by financial institutions, which is expected to result in heightened levels of enforcement 
action across the industry.  
The 76 recommendations covered many of the Issuers business areas, and also canvassed the role of 
the regulators and the approach to be taken to customer focus, culture and remuneration. The 
recommendations regarding the role of regulators, in particular the litigate first approach for breaches 
of financial services law, will likely lead to a change in the Issuers regulator relationships and the 
Issuer can expect an increase of activity, costs and reputational impact in this area. The Issuer released a 
statement to the ASX on 8 March 2019 welcoming the final report and committing to actions to deliver 
on the recommendations.  
Damage to the Issuers reputation could harm its business, financial condition, operations and 
prospects 
The Issuers reputation is a valuable asset and a key contributor to the support that it receives from the 
community for its business initiatives and its ability to raise funding or capital. Damage to the Issuers 
reputation may arise where there are differences between stakeholder expectations and the Issuers 
actual or perceived practices. The risk of reputational damage may also be a secondary outcome of 
other sources of risk.  
Various issues, including a number of the risks described herein, may give rise to reputational damage 
and cause harm to the Issuers business, financial condition, operations and prospects. These issues 
include the conduct of the Issuer (for example, inadequate sales and trading practices, inappropriate 
management of conflicts of interest and other ethical issues), breaches of legal and regulatory 
requirements (such as money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions and privacy 
laws), technology and information security failures, unsuccessful strategies or strategies that are not in 
line with community expectations and non-compliance with internal policies and procedures. The 
Issuers reputation may also be adversely affected by community perception of the broader financial 
services industry, or from the actions of its competitors, customers, suppliers or companies in which the 
Issuer holds strategic investments.  
Failure, or perceived failure, to address these issues appropriately could also give rise to additional legal 
or regulatory risk, subjecting the Issuer to regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or further 
damage the Issuers reputation and integrity among its stakeholders including customers, investors and 
the community. 
The Issuer may be adversely impacted by a downturn in the Australian or New Zealand economies 
As the Issuers businesses are primarily located in Australia and New Zealand, its performance is 
dependent on the state of these economies, customer and investor confidence, and prevailing market 
conditions in these two countries.  
The Issuer can give no assurances as to the likely future conditions of the Australian and New Zealand 
economies, which can be influenced by many factors within and outside these countries, which are 
outside of its control, including domestic and international economic events, political events, natural 
disasters and any other event that impacts global financial markets.

China is one of Australias major trading partners and a significant driver of commodity demand and 
prices in many of the markets in which the Issuer and its customers operate. Anything that adversely 
affects Chinas economic growth, including the implementation of tariffs or other protectionist trade 
policy, could adversely affect Australian economic activity and, as a result, the Issuers business, 
financial condition, operations and prospects.  
The strength of the Australian economy is influenced by the strength of the Australian dollar. 
Significant movements in the Australian dollar may adversely impact parts of the Australian economy 
and, in turn, the Issuers results of operations. See "Failure to hedge effectively against market risks 
(including adverse fluctuations in exchange rates) could negatively impact the Issuers results of 
operations" for more information.  
A material downturn in the Australian or New Zealand economies could adversely impact the Issuers 
results by reducing customers demand for the Issuers products and borrowers ability to repay their 
loans to the Issuer (i.e. credit risk). In particular, given the Issuers concentration of earnings from 
home loans, a significant or sustained decrease in the Australian and New Zealand housing markets or 
property valuations, including external factors or tightening lending standards could adversely affect the 
Issuer's home and commercial mortgage portfolio, result in a decrease in the amount of new lending the 
Issuer is able to undertake and/or increase the losses that the Issuer may experience from existing loans. 
These factors could adversely affect the Issuers business, financial condition, operations and prospects.  
The demand for residential property may also decline due to buyer concerns about decreases in value, 
regulatory or tax changes or concerns about rising interest rates, which could impact demand for the 
Issuers home lending products. Recently, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (the ABS) reported that 
residential property prices (as a weighted average of eight capital cities) declined 3.0 per cent. over the 
quarter ended 31 March 2019 and declined by 7.4 per cent. over the year ended 31 March 2019 
(compared to growth of 2.0 per cent. over the year ended 31 March 2019). In April 2018 APRA 
announced its decision to remove its 10 per cent. cap on investor-loan growth and in December 2018 
removed its supervisory benchmark on interest-only lending.  This will be replaced with a series of 
more permanent measures to strengthen residential mortgage lending standards. If regulators impose 
further supervisory measures that impact the Issuers mortgage lending practices, Australian housing 
price growth significantly subsides or property valuations decline, the demand for the Issuers home 
lending products may decrease and loan defaults could increase due to declining collateral values. This 
would adversely affect the Issuers business, operations and financial condition. 
Adverse impacts on the Issuers commercial mortgage portfolio could emanate from lower levels of 
new origination activity and increased losses due to deteriorating security values and a less active 
refinancing market. A material decline in residential housing prices could also cause increased losses 
from the Issuers exposures to residential property developers, particularly if such developers 
customers that are pre-committed to purchase the completed dwellings are unable or unwilling to 
complete their contracts and the Issuer is forced to sell these dwellings for less than the pre-committed 
contract price. 
The Issuer may be adversely affected by general business and economic conditions and disruptions 
in the global financial markets  
By the nature of its operations in various financial markets the Issuer has previously been adversely 
impacted, both directly and indirectly, by difficult business, economic and market conditions and could 
be adversely affected should markets deteriorate again in the future. The financial system (or systems) 
within which it operates may experience systemic shock due to market volatility, political or economic 
instability or catastrophic events.   
A shock to or deterioration in the global economy could result in currency and interest rate fluctuations 
and operational disruptions that negatively impact the Issuer. For example, global economic conditions 
may deteriorate to the extent that counterparties default on their debt obligations; countries re-
denominate their currencies and/or introduce capital controls; one or more major economies collapse; 
and/or global financial markets cease to operate, or cease to operate efficiently. Sovereign defaults may 
adversely impact the Issuer directly, through adversely impacting the value of the Issuers assets, or 
indirectly through destabilising global financial markets, adversely impacting the Issuers liquidity, 
financial performance or ability to access capital. 
While economic factors are solid, downside risks to the global economy remain at the forefront.  
Globally monetary policy remains accommodative, and central banks are citing low inflation rates and 
downside risks to growth as reasons that could see them provide further stimulus if required.  Lasting 
impacts from the global financial crisis and the potential for escalation in geopolitical risks suggest on-
going vulnerability and potential adjustment of consumer and business behaviour especially in the

context of still high debt levels. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve lifted interest rates between 
December 2015 and December 2018 but has now placed interest rate rises on hold but have suggested 
interest rate cuts are under consideration as uncertainties and muted inflation pressures persist. The 
RBA lowered interest rates in both June 2019 and July 2019, down to historic low levels, in order to 
help reduce spare capacity in the labour market and the economy. Further rate cuts cannot be ruled out. 
The monetary policies of central monetary authorities can significantly affect the Issuers cost of funds 
for lending and investing, as well as the return that the Issuer earns on those loans and investments. 
These factors impact the Issuers net interest margin and can affect the value of financial instruments it 
holds, such as debt securities and hedging instruments. The policies of the central monetary authorities 
can affect the Issuers borrowers and other counterparties, potentially increasing the risk that the 
Issuers borrowers and other counterparties may fail to repay loans or other financial obligations to the 
Issuer. Monetary policies also have a broader impact on the Issuers customers spending and savings 
activity, which will in turn, affect the Issuers performance. Changes in such policies can be difficult to 
predict. 
Additionally, on 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU (Brexit) in a referendum 
and on 29 March 2017 gave notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to commence the 
legal process to end the United Kingdoms membership of the EU. As part of the negotiations between 
the UK and the EU regarding the terms of the UKs withdrawal from the EU and the framework of the 
future relationship between the UK and the EU (the article 50 withdrawal agreement), a transitional 
period has been agreed in principle which would extend the application of EU law, and provide for 
continuing access to the EU single market, until the end of 2020. There may be an extended period of 
increased uncertainty and volatility in the global financial markets due to the on-going political 
uncertainty as regards the terms of the UKs withdrawal from the EU and the structure of the future 
relationship. The United Kingdoms decision to leave the EU may adversely affect the Issuers ability 
to raise medium or long term funding in the international capital markets and there is potential for 
further consequences of Brexit to adversely impact the financial markets. It remains uncertain whether 
the article 50 withdrawal agreement will be finalised and ratified by the UK and the EU. If it is not 
ratified, the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 
will cease to apply to the UK from that date. 
Furthermore, since January 2017 the United States administration has outlined a political and economic 
agenda for the United States that, in certain ways, significantly differs from previous trade, tax, fiscal, 
regulatory and other policies of the United States. In particular, the current United States administration 
has pursued a protectionist trade policy which includes a series of expansive tariffs, up to and including 
the entirety of goods traded between the United States and China, which may result in adverse effects 
on the economy of China, one of Australias major trading partners and a significant driver of 
commodity demand and prices in the markets in which the Issuer and its customers operate. Anything 
that adversely affects Chinas economic growth could adversely affect Australian economic activity 
and, as a result, the Issuers business, financial condition, operations and prospects. 
The Issuer is subject to intense competition which may adversely affect its results  
The Issuer faces intense competition in all of its principal areas of operation. Competition is expected to 
increase, especially from non-Australian financial services providers who continue to expand in 
Australia, and from new non-bank entrants or smaller providers who may be unregulated or subject to 
lower or different prudential and regulatory standards than the Issuer and are therefore able to operate 
more efficiently. These entrants may seek to disrupt the financial services industry by offering bundled 
propositions and utilising new technologies.  
If the Issuer is unable to compete effectively in its various businesses and markets, its market share may 
decline and increased competition may also adversely affect the Issuers results by diverting business to 
competitors or creating pressure to lower margins to maintain market share.  
The Issuer may incur losses from operational risks associated with being a large financial institution  
Operational risk is defined as the risk of economic gain or loss resulting from (i) inadequate or failed 
internal processes and methodologies; (ii) people; (iii) systems and models used in making business 
decisions; or (iv) external events.  
The Issuers use of third party suppliers and third party partnerships, especially those where they supply 
the Issuer with critical services such as key technology systems or support, also expose it to operational 
risks including the potential for a severe event at a third party impacting the Issuer.  
The Issuer's businesses are highly dependent on their ability to process and monitor a very large number 
of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across multiple markets and in many currencies. 
For personal use only
 
18 
The Issuer's financial, accounting, record keeping, data processing or other operating systems, 
processes and facilities may fail to function properly or may become disabled as a result of events that 
are wholly or partially beyond its control, such as a spike in transaction volumes, damage to critical 
utilities, environmental hazard, natural disaster, or a failure of vendors systems. The Issuer could suffer 
losses due to impairment of assets, including software, goodwill and other intangible assets.  
There is also a risk that poor decisions may be made due to data quality issues, models that are not fit 
for purpose, or inappropriate data management. This may cause the Issuer to incur losses, or result in 
regulatory action.  
Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the Issuers accounting policies so that 
not only do they comply with generally accepted accounting principles but they also reflect the most 
appropriate manner in which to record and report on the financial position and results of operations of 
the Issuer. While the Issuer has processes to set and ensure compliance with the Issuers accounting 
policies these processes may not always be effective. Application of and changes to accounting policies 
may adversely impact the Issuers results. 
The Issuer may also be adversely impacted by failures in the efficacy, adequacy or implementation of 
its risk management strategies, frameworks and processes. The emergence of unexpected risks or 
unanticipated impacts of identified risks may result in financial or reputational losses for the Issuer.  
The Issuer may be adversely impacted by information security risks, including cyber-attacks 
The Issuers businesses are highly dependent on its information technology systems, including those 
supplied by external service providers, to securely process, store, keep private and transmit information. 
These information technology systems are subject to information security risks. Information security 
risks for the Issuer have increased in recent years, in part because of: (i) the pervasiveness of 
technology to conduct financial transactions; (ii) the evolution and development of new technologies; 
(iii) the Issuers increasing usage of digital channels; (iv) customers increasing use of personal devices 
that are beyond the Issuers control systems; and (v) the increased sophistication and broadened 
activities of cyber criminals.  
Although the Issuer takes protective measures and endeavours to modify these protective measures as 
circumstances warrant, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorised 
access, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, computer viruses or other malicious code 
and other events. These threats could result in the unauthorised release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, 
loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the Issuer, its employees, 
customers or third parties or otherwise adversely impact network access or business operations. 
An information security failure (including the impact of any cyber-attack) could have serious 
consequences for the Issuer including operational disruption, financial losses, a loss of customer or 
business opportunities, litigation, regulatory penalties or intervention, reputational damage, theft of 
intellectual property, loss or theft of customer data, and could result in violations of applicable privacy 
laws. 
Human capital risk including the loss of key executives, employees or Board members may adversely 
affect the Issuers business, operations and financial condition  
The Issuers ability to attract and retain qualified and skilled executives, employees and Board members 
is an important factor in achieving the strategic objectives of CBA and its subsidiaries (the Group). 
The Chief Executive Officer, the management team of the Chief Executive Officer and the Board have 
skills that are critical to setting the strategic direction, successful management and growth of the Issuer, 
and whose loss due to resignation, retirement, death or illness may adversely affect the Issuers 
business, operations and financial condition.  
If the Issuer has difficulty retaining or attracting highly qualified people for important roles, including 
key executives and Board members, particularly in times of strategic change, the Issuers business, 
operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
The Issuer could suffer losses due to climate change 
Climate change is systemic in nature, and is a significant long-term driver of both financial and non-
financial risks. A failure to respond to the potential and expected impacts of climate change will affect 
the Issuers long-term performance and can be expected to have group-wide impacts for the Group in 
its lending (retail and business), procurement and investment portfolios. These include, but are not 
limited to, impacts on the probability of default and losses arising from defaults, valuations and 
collateral as well as portfolio performance.

19 
The Issuer recognises that inadequate assessment and management of the physical risk (arising from 
extreme weather events and longer-term shifts in climate patterns) and transition risk (arising from 
legal, market, policy, technology and reputational changes associated with a transition to a low carbon 
economy) of climate change, have the potential to disrupt business activities, damage property and 
otherwise affect the value of assets, and affect our customers ability to repay loans.  
Climate change therefore has the potential to impact the Groups franchise value, strategic risk and 
financial risk and poses a risk to the Issuers cost of capital. 
The Issuer is subject to compliance risks, which could adversely impact the Issuers results and 
reputation  
Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or loss of reputation 
that the Issuer may suffer as a result of its failure to comply, or perceived failure to comply, with the 
requirements of relevant laws, regulatory bodies, industry standards and codes. Increasing volume, 
complexity and global reach of such requirements, and the increased propensity for sanctions and the 
level of financial penalties for breaches of requirements, could adversely impact the Issuers results and 
reputation.  
This includes for example, financial crime related obligations such as anti-money laundering and 
counter-terrorism financing laws, anti-bribery and corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions 
laws in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer operates. The number and wide reach of these obligations, 
combined with the increasing global focus on compliance with and enforcement of these obligations, 
presents a risk of adverse impacts on the Issuer including to its reputation.  
Compliance risk may also arise where the Issuer interprets its obligations differently from regulators or 
a court.  
Substantial legal liability or regulatory action against the Issuer may adversely affect the Issuers 
business, financial condition, operations, prospects and reputation  
Due to the nature of the Issuers business, it is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory 
proceedings, principally in Australia and New Zealand. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, 
and the outcome of individual matters cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Issuer is ordered to pay 
money (for example, damages, fines, penalties or legal costs), has orders made against its assets (for 
example, a charging order or writ of execution), is ordered to carry out actions which adversely affect 
its business operations or reputation (for example, corrective advertising) or is otherwise subject to 
adverse outcomes of litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, the Issuers business, financial 
condition, operations, prospects and reputation may be adversely affected.  
On 20 June 2018 the Federal Court of Australia approved the agreement between the Issuer and 
AUSTRAC to resolve the civil penalty proceedings commenced by AUSTRAC on 3 August 2017 
concerning contraventions of four provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism 
Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (the AML/CTF Act). Accordingly, the Issuer recognised a A$700 million 
expense in its financial statements for the full year ended 30 June 2018. 
The Issuer has also acted to strengthen financial crime capabilities more broadly, and has invested 
significantly recognising the crucial role that it plays, including through its Program of Action with 
coverage across all aspects of financial crime (including Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism (AML/CTF), sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption) and all business units 
Although the Issuer provides updates to AUSTRAC and the Issuers other regulators on the Program of 
Action implemented by the Issuer following the civil penalty proceedings commenced against it by 
AUSTRAC, there is no assurance that AUSTRAC or the Issuers other regulators will agree that the 
Issuers Program of Action will be adequate or that the Program of Action will effectively enhance the 
Issuers compliance programs. 
In September 2017, following the commencement of the civil proceedings against the Issuer by 
AUSTRAC, ASIC launched an investigation in relation to the Issuers disclosure in respect of the 
allegations raised in connection with the AUSTRAC proceedings. ASIC is investigating, among other 
things, whether the officers and directors at the Issuer complied with their obligations under the 
Corporations Act. The Issuer continues to engage with ASIC in respect of the investigation and to 
respond to requests made by ASIC. It is currently not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this 
investigation, if any, on the Issuer. 
While the Issuer is not currently aware of any other enforcement action by other domestic or foreign 
regulators relating to the allegations raised by AUSTRAC (or similar matters) as of the date of this 
For personal use only
 
20 
Information Memorandum, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will not be subject to such 
enforcement actions in the future. The settlement of the proceedings commenced by AUSTRAC, or any 
other formal or informal proceeding or investigation by other government or regulatory agencies 
(domestic or foreign), may result in additional litigation, or proceedings by other regulators or private 
parties.  
This risk is evidenced by the shareholder class action proceeding that was commenced in the Federal 
Court of Australia on 9 October 2017 alleging breaches of the Groups continuous disclosure 
obligations and misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the subject matter of the civil penalty 
proceedings brought by AUSTRAC. It is alleged that the Issuers shareholders who acquired an interest 
in the Issuers ordinary shares between 1 July 2015 and 3 August 2017 suffered loss caused by the 
alleged conduct.  
A similar subject matter shareholder class action was filed on 29 June 2018 by law firm Phi Finney 
McDonald on behalf of a group of shareholders who acquired an interest in the Issuers ordinary shares 
between 16 June 2014 and 3 August 2017.  
The Issuer intends to vigorously defend both shareholder class actions. At this time it is not possible to 
reliably estimate the possible financial impact on the Issuer of these class actions. Accordingly, no loss 
provision has been made, although the Issuer has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred to 
defend these claims. 
Additionally, in some of the Issuers contractual arrangements, the Issuer provides representations and 
warranties regarding its compliance with the AML/CTF Act and other applicable anti-money 
laundering and counter-terrorism rules and regulations. Because of the settlement with AUSTRAC, the 
Issuer may be exposed to potential claims from its contractual counterparties to the extent such 
counterparties believe that the Issuer has breached the applicable representations and warranties 
contained in the Issuers contractual arrangements with them and have suffered loss as a result of any 
such breach. The Issuer is not aware of any such claims as of the date of this Information 
Memorandum. Such investigations, actions, claims or proceedings, could result in penalties, fines and 
costs, reputational harm, remediation costs and other losses that, individually or collectively, could have 
a material adverse effect on the Issuers business, financial condition, operations, prospects and 
reputation. 
On 9 October 2018, Slater and Gordon Lawyers filed a class action claim against the Issuer and 
Colonial First State Investments Limited (CFSIL) in the Victorian Registry of the Federal Court of 
Australia. The Issuer is the second respondent to this claim.  The claim relates to investment in cash and 
deposit options (which are the Issuers cash and deposit products) in Colonial First State FirstChoice 
Superannuation Trust and Commonwealth Essential Super. The main allegation is that members with 
these options in the funds received lower interest rates on them than they would have had CFSIL put 
them in equivalent products with the highest interest rates obtainable on the market. It is alleged that the 
Issuer was involved in CFSILs breaches as trustee of the funds and CFSILs breaches as Responsible 
Entity of the underlying managed investment schemes. It is currently not possible to determine the 
ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on the Group.  Both the Issuer and CFSIL deny the allegations 
and filed a defence to the claim. However Slater and Gordon Lawyers have made further amendments 
to the claim and the Issuer and CFSIL filed a defence to the amended claim on 7 June 2019. The 
amendments introduce additional allegations relating to another term deposit and a breach of trust in 
respect of adviser commissions; however the commissions claim is made against CFSIL only.  The 
Group has made provision for the legal costs estimated to be incurred in the defence of the claim. 
Additionally, the settlement in the AUSTRAC proceedings and other investigations, actions, claims and 
proceedings may harm the Issuers business and results by negatively impacting the Issuers reputation 
among the Issuers customers, investors and other stakeholders. Reputational harm could result in the 
loss of customers or restrict the Issuers ability to access the capital markets on favourable terms, which 
could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer s business, financial condition, operations, prospects 
and reputation.  
During the 2018 financial year, A$389 million of expense provisions were recognised for financial 
crimes compliance, the Royal Commission, the Prudential Inquiry (as defined below), the AUSTRAC 
civil proceedings, shareholder class actions and the ASIC investigation.  
Furthermore, in recent years there have been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory 
investigations and reviews, enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise) and the 
quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and 
globally. The nature of these investigations and reviews can be wide ranging.

Following the inquiry conducted by an independent panel into the Group with the goal of identifying 
shortcomings in the governance, culture and accountability frameworks (the Prudential Inquiry), 
APRA released the panels final report on 1 May 2018 (the Final Report). The Final Report made a 
number of findings regarding the complex interplay of organisational and cultural factors within the 
Issuer and the need for enhanced management of non-financial risks. In response to the Final Report, 
the Issuer has acknowledged that it will implement all of the recommendations and has agreed to adjust 
its minimum capital requirements by an additional A$1 billion (risk weighted assets A$12.5 billion) 
until such time as the recommendations are implemented to APRAs satisfaction. The effect of this 
adjustment equates to 28 basis points of CET1 capital and reduces the Issuers CET1 ratio as at 30 
September 2018 from 10.3 per cent. to 10 per cent. 
The Issuer has entered into an Enforceable Undertaking under which the Issuers remedial action plan 
(the Remedial Action Plan) in response to the Final Report is monitored by APRA.  
The Remedial Action Plan provides a detailed program of change outlining how the Issuer will improve 
the way it runs its business, manages risk, and works with regulators. The Remedial Action Plan 
provides a comprehensive assurance framework, with Promontory Australasia (Sydney) having been 
appointed as the independent reviewer and is required to report to APRA on the Groups progress 
regularly, with the first report being submitted on 28 September 2018 and the second report on 20 
December 2018. Both these reports have been released by the Issuer. Promontory Australasia (Sydney) 
has noted that the Remedial Action Plan program of work remains on track and the Issuers 
commitment to implementing the Prudential Inquirys recommendations in a timely and comprehensive 
way continued to be strong with all milestones on schedule to be delivered by the due dates. A third 
report was submitted to APRA on 30 April 2019. This report has yet to be released by the Issuer. 
During the financial year ended 30 June 2019, the Issuer has also received various notices and requests 
for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Bank-specific reviews. There may 
be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class 
actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total 
costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain. However, should any 
regulatory investigations and reviews result in fines, the Issuers business, financial condition, 
operations, prospects and reputation may be adversely affected. 
The Issuer may incur losses as a result of the inappropriate conduct of its staff. 
The Issuer could be adversely affected if an employee, contractor or external service provider does not 
act in accordance with regulations or its policies and procedures, engages in inappropriate or fraudulent 
conduct, or unintentionally fails to meet a professional obligation to specific clients. Examples are 
inadequate or defective financial advice, product defects and unsuitability, market manipulation, insider 
trading, privacy or data security breaches and misleading or deceptive conduct in advertising. As a 
result, the Issuer could incur losses, financial penalties and reputational damage, and could be subject to 
legal or regulatory action. 
The Issuer may incur losses associated with counterparty exposures 
The Issuer assumes counterparty risk in connection with its lending, trading, derivatives, insurance and 
other businesses as it relies on the ability of its counterparties to satisfy their financial obligations to the 
Issuer on a timely basis. For example, customers may default on their home, personal and business 
loans, and trades may fail to settle due to non-payment by a counterparty or a systems failure by 
clearing agents, exchanges or other financial intermediaries. This risk also arises from the Issuers 
exposure to lenders mortgage insurance and re-insurance providers. There is also a risk that the 
Issuers rights against counterparties may not be enforceable in certain circumstances. 
Counterparties may default on their obligations due to insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure 
or other reasons. This risk may be increased by a deterioration in economic conditions and a sustained 
high level of unemployment. In assessing whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the 
Issuer relies on counterparties providing information that is accurate and not misleading, including 
financial statements and other financial information. The Issuers financial performance could be 
negatively impacted to the extent that it relies on information that is inaccurate or materially 
misleading. 
Unexpected credit losses could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuers business, financial 
condition, operations and prospects. 
The Issuers results may be adversely affected by liquidity and funding risks  
For personal use only
 
22 
The Issuer is subject to liquidity and funding risks, which could adversely impact the Issuers results. 
Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet financial obligations as and when they fall due. 
Funding risk is the risk of over-reliance on a funding source to the extent that a change or increased 
competition in that funding source could increase overall funding costs or cause difficulty in raising 
funds.  
Further information on liquidity and funding risk is outlined in note 9.4 to the Issuers audited 
consolidated and non-consolidated annual financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 
2018 which provides an overview of the Issuers liquidity and funding risk management framework.   
Adverse financial and credit market conditions may significantly affect the Issuers ability to access 
international debt markets, on which it relies for a substantial amount of its wholesale funding  
While the majority of the Issuers funding comes from deposits, it remains reliant on off-shore 
wholesale funding markets to source a significant amount of its funding and grow its business.  
Global market volatility may adversely impact the cost and the Issuers ability to access wholesale 
funding markets and may also result in increased competition for, and therefore the cost of, deposits in 
Australia. 
If the Issuer is unable to pass its increased funding costs on to its customers, its financial performance 
will decline due to lower net interest margins. If the Issuer is forced to seek alternative sources of 
funding, the availability of such alternative funding and the terms on which it may be available will 
depend on a variety of factors, including prevailing financial and credit market conditions. Even if 
available, the cost of these alternatives may be more expensive or they may only be available on 
unfavourable terms, which may adversely impact the Issuers cost of borrowing and the Issuers on-
going operations and funding. If the Issuer is unable to source appropriate and timely funding, it may 
also be forced to reduce its lending or consider selling assets.  
The Issuer may not be able to maintain adequate levels of liquidity and funding, which would adversely 
affect the Issuers business, financial condition, operations and prospects  
The Issuers liquidity and funding policies are designed to ensure that it will meet its debts and other 
obligations as and when they fall due. Although the Issuer actively monitors and manages its liquidity 
and funding positions, there are factors outside of its control which could adversely affect these 
positions, for example if financial markets are closed for an extended period of time. 
In addition to APRAs Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirements (effective 1 January 2015), the Issuer 
must comply with the Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements, which came into effect from 1 January 
2018. If the Issuer fails to maintain adequate levels of liquidity and funding, it would adversely affect 
the Issuers business, financial condition, operations and prospects. 
Failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the Issuers cost of funds, liquidity, access to 
debt and capital markets and competitive position  
The Issuers credit ratings (which are strongly influenced by Australias sovereign credit rating) affect 
the cost and availability of its funding from debt and other funding sources. Credit ratings could be used 
by potential customers, lenders and investors in deciding whether to transact with or invest in the 
Issuer.  
A downgrade to the Issuers credit ratings, or Australias sovereign credit rating, could adversely affect 
the Issuers cost of funds, liquidity, access to debt and capital markets, collateralisation requirements 
and competitive position. 
Failure to maintain capital adequacy requirements would adversely affect the Issuers financial 
condition  
The Issuer must satisfy substantial capital requirements, subject to qualitative and quantitative review 
and assessment by its regulators. Regulatory capital requirements influence how the Issuer uses its 
capital, and can restrict its ability to pay dividends and Additional Tier 1 distributions, or to make stock 
repurchases. The Issuers capital ratios may be affected by a number of factors, including earnings, 
asset growth, changes in the value of the Australian dollar against other currencies in which the Issuer 
conducts its business, and changes in business strategy (including acquisitions, divestments, 
investments and changes in capital intensive businesses). 
The Issuer operates an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (the ICAAP) to manage its 
capital levels and to maintain them above the minimum levels approved by the Board (which are 
For personal use only
 
23 
currently set to exceed regulatory requirements). The ICAAP includes forecasting and stress testing of 
capital levels, which guides the Issuer in selecting any capital management initiatives it may undertake.  
Should the ICAAP forecasts or stress tests prove to be ineffective, the Issuer may not be holding 
sufficient capital and may need to raise capital to manage balance sheet growth and/or extreme stress.  
APRA has implemented a number of actions in response to the final report of the Financial System 
Inquiry (FSI) released in December 2014, including the reports recommendation that Australian 
ADIs be required to operate with unquestionably strong capital ratios. 
In July 2017, APRA released an information paper Strengthening banking sector resilience  
establishing unquestionably strong capital ratios in which it stated that in order to meet the objective of 
having unquestionably strong capital ratios, Australias major banks would need to operate with an 
average benchmark ratio of CET1 Capital to RWA of 10.5 per cent. or more by 1 January 2020. 
Separately, on 7 December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued Basel III: 
Finalising post-crisis reforms confirming new measures designed to address deficiencies in the 
international regulatory capital framework following the global financial crisis, primarily focused on 
addressing excessive variability in RWA , and therefore capital requirements, across banks. 
In response, on 14 February 2018, APRA released a discussion paper titled Discussion Paper  
Revisions to the capital framework for authorised deposit-taking institutions (the Paper) to 
commence its consultation on revisions to the capital framework. The Paper outlines the main 
components of the revisions APRA expects to make to the risk-based capital requirements for ADIs 
using the advanced and standardised approach to credit, market and operational risk. Amongst other 
things, the Paper seeks to address systemic concentration of ADI portfolios in residential mortgages and 
the proposals seek to target higher-risk residential mortgage lending, including investment and interest 
only loans. APRA has stated that it expects the overall impact of the proposals in the Paper to be a net 
increase in ADIs RWA. APRA has noted that all else being equal, this will reduce an ADIs reported 
capital ratios, even though there is no change to the ADIs underlying risk profile or to the quantum of 
capital required to achieve capital ratios that are unquestionably strong. 
In August 2018, APRA released a second discussion paper titled Discussion paper - Improving the 
transparency, comparability and flexibility of the ADI capital framework. APRA proposes two key 
options for achieving comparability, without changing the quantum or allocation of capital. The first 
option is similar to the current approach, with the additional disclosure of APRA prescribed 
internationally comparable capital ratios, alongside the current APRA regulatory capital ratios. The 
second option will result in only one set of APRA regulatory capital ratios that are more internationally 
harmonised than the current approach. The latter will be achieved by removing certain aspects of 
APRAs relative conservatisms from an ADIs capital ratio calculations and lifting minimum regulatory 
capital ratio requirements in tandem. 
The outcome of these discussion papers, and the overall review of the capital framework, will 
determine whether APRA may recalibrate the benchmark 10.5 per cent. CET1 ratio applicable to major 
banks. However, APRAs expectation is that this will not necessitate additional capital raisings by 
ADIs nor alter the risk sensitivity of capital requirements. 
APRAs intention is that the quantum of capital required to be held by ADIs under the revised capital 
framework can be accommodated within the amount of capital they would have needed to hold to meet 
the benchmark CET1 ratio by January 2020. 
Revisions to APRAs prudential standards will be subject to consultation before becoming effective 
from 1 January 2022. 
Consistent with the Issuers approach to capital management, the Issuer will aim to achieve 
unquestionably strong capital ratios through a range of initiatives, including organic capital 
generation, prudent capital management and announced asset sales. 
In addition to the revisions to the capital framework, APRA has announced it intends to implement 
other capital related FSI recommendations, including a framework for minimum loss-absorbing and 
recapitalisation capacity and the introduction of a minimum Leverage Ratio requirement for ADIs.  
 
In February 2018, APRA released a discussion paper titled Discussion Paper  Leverage ratio 
requirements for authorised deposit-taking institutions.  Following consultation, in November 
2018, APRA announced that it would set a minimum Leverage Ratio requirement of 3.5 per cent. 
for internal ratings-based approach (IRB) ADIs, which will apply from 1 January 2022.

In February 2018, the Australian Government passed legislation to give APRA additional powers 
for crisis resolution and resolution planning in relation to regulated entities. This includes 
providing certainty that capital instruments can be converted or written off as intended in APRAs 
prudential standards. 
 
On 8 November 2018, APRA released a discussion paper titled Discussion Paper  increasing the 
loss-absorbing capacity of ADIs to support orderly resolution. The paper recommends that the 
Australian loss-absorbing regime be established under the existing capital framework, rather than 
by introducing new forms of loss-absorbing instruments. For D-SIBs, APRA proposes an increase 
in the Total Capital requirement of between four and five percentage points of RWA, with the 
requirements taking full effect from 2023. APRA further notes that it is anticipated that the banks 
would satisfy this requirement predominantly with additional Tier 2 capital. The Group expects 
that this requirement would result in a decrease in other forms of funding. It is expected that APRA 
will finalise its requirements in late 2019. 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is undertaking a comprehensive review of the capital adequacy 
framework applying to registered banks in New Zealand. The latest consultation paper titled Capital 
Review Paper 4: How much capital is enough? released in December 2018  includes proposals to 
increase New Zealand IRB banks RWA to 90 per cent. of standardised RWA and to increase the 
minimum Tier 1 capital requirement for banks which are deemed systemically important to 16 per cent. 
of RWA (currently 8.5 per cent.). Consultation on the proposals is now closed with final policy 
decisions expected in November 2019. 
The Groups failure to meet the capital requirements discussed above, or any future proposed capital 
requirements if enacted, would adversely affect its financial condition. 
Failure to hedge effectively against market risks (including adverse fluctuations in exchange rates) 
could negatively impact the Issuers results of operations  
The Issuer is exposed to market risks, including the potential for losses arising from adverse changes in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices, credit spreads and implied volatility 
levels for assets and liabilities where options are transacted. This exposure is split between traded 
market risks, primarily through providing services to customers on a global basis, and non-traded 
market risks, predominately interest rate risk in the Issuers banking book.  
A significant proportion of the Issuers wholesale funding and some of its profits and investments are in 
currencies other than the Australian dollar, principally the U.S. dollar and the Euro. This exposes the 
Issuer to exchange rate risk on these activities, as the Issuers functional and financial reporting 
currency is the Australian dollar. These activities are hedged where appropriate, however there are also 
risks associated with hedging, for example, a hedge counterparty may default on its obligations to the 
Issuer. For a description of these specific risks, see note 9.3 to the Issuers audited consolidated and 
non-consolidated annual financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2018. There can be 
no assurance that the Issuers exchange rate hedging arrangements or hedging policy will be sufficient 
or effective. The Issuers results of operations may be adversely affected if its hedges are not effective 
to mitigate exchange rate risks, if the Issuer is inappropriately hedged or if a hedge provider defaults on 
its obligations under the Issuers hedging agreements. 
The Issuers results could be adversely impacted by strategic risks  
Strategic risk is the risk of material value destruction or less than planned value creation, due to an 
inadequate strategy. Examples of strategic risk include:  
 
suboptimal allocation and balance of the Issuers resources to execute on its strategic objectives;  
 
ineffective delivery of the Issuers strategy (for example due to operational complexity or the pace 
of execution being too fast for processes, people and systems to work as they need to, or too slow 
to keep pace with the changing environment); and 
 
the inability of the Issuer to keep pace with intensified competition from traditional and non-
traditional financial services players across key value pools.  
While the Board regularly monitors and discusses the Issuers operating environment, strategic 
objectives and implementation of major strategic initiatives, there can be no assurance that such 
objectives and initiatives will be successful or that they will not adversely impact the Issuer.

The Issuer's performance and financial position may be adversely affected by acquisitions or 
divestments of businesses 
The Issuer may divest businesses or capabilities it considers non-core or wind down businesses or 
product areas. For example, the Issuer is currently undertaking a number of divestments and strategic 
reviews of certain businesses. 
There is a risk that the cost and pace of executing divestments, including as a result of external 
approvals, may cause the Issuer to experience disruptions in the divestment, transition or wind down 
process, including to existing businesses, which may cause customers to remove their business from the 
Issuer or have other adverse impacts for the Issuer. 
From time to time, the Issuer evaluates and undertakes acquisitions of other businesses. There is a risk 
that the Issuer may not achieve the expected synergies from the acquisition, and may experience 
disruptions to its existing businesses due to difficulties in integrating the systems and processes of the 
acquired business. These may cause the Issuer to lose customers and market share, and incur financial 
losses. 
Multiple divestments and/or acquisitions at the same time may exacerbate these risks.  
The Issuer could be adversely impacted by investor activism  
In recent times, the Issuer has been increasingly challenged on its strategy by shareholders, including 
institutional shareholders and special interest groups. Areas which have attracted investor activism in 
Australia include making socially responsible investment and avoiding financing or interacting with 
businesses that do not demonstrate responsible management of environmental and social issues. The 
prevalence of investor activism could adversely impact managements decision-making and 
implementation of the Issuers initiatives, which in turn could adversely affect its financial results.   
The Issuer may be adversely impacted by insurance risk 
Events that the Issuer has provided insurance against may occur more frequently or with greater 
severity than anticipated, which could adversely impact the Issuer. In the Issuers life insurance 
business, this risk arises primarily through mortality (death) and morbidity (illness and injury) related 
claims being greater than expected. In the Issuers general insurance business, this risk is mainly driven 
by weather related incidents (such as storms, floods or bushfires) and other catastrophes.  
FACTORS WHICH ARE MATERIAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE MARKET 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXEMPT NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAMME 
Risks related to the structure of a particular issue of Exempt Notes 
A wide range of Exempt Notes may be issued under the Programme. A number of these Exempt Notes 
may have features which contain particular risks for potential investors. Set out below is a description 
of the most common such features: 
If the Issuer has the right to redeem any Exempt Notes at its option, this may limit the market value of 
the Exempt Notes concerned and an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a 
manner which achieves a similar effective return. 
An optional redemption feature is likely to limit the market value of Exempt Notes. During any period 
when the Issuer may elect to redeem Exempt Notes, the market value of those Exempt Notes generally 
will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to 
any redemption period. 
The Issuer may be expected to redeem Exempt Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the 
interest rate on the Exempt Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest 
the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Exempt Notes 
being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should 
consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time. 
In the case of Subordinated Notes, any optional redemption is also subject to the further considerations 
described in "Risks specific to Subordinated Notes  The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at the 
option of the Issuer" below.

The interest rate on Fixed Reset Notes will reset on each Reset Date, which can be expected to affect 
interest payments on an investment in Fixed Reset Notes and could affect the secondary market and the 
market value of the Fixed Reset Notes concerned 
Fixed Reset Notes will initially bear interest at the Initial Interest Rate until (but excluding) the Reset 
Date. On the Reset Date, the interest rate will be reset to the rate per annum equal to the aggregate of 
the applicable Reset Reference Rate and the Margin as determined by the Principal Paying Agent on the 
relevant Reset Determination Date (each such interest rate being the "Reset Rate"). The Reset Rate for 
any Reset Period could be less than the Initial Interest Rate and could therefore adversely affect the 
market value of an investment in the Fixed Reset Notes. 
If the Exempt Notes include a feature to convert the interest basis from a fixed rate to a floating rate, or 
vice versa, or the terms of the Exempt Notes otherwise provide for such conversion, this may affect the 
secondary market and the market value of the Exempt Notes concerned 
Fixed/Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate that converts from a fixed rate to a floating rate, or 
from a floating rate to a fixed rate. Such a feature to convert the interest basis, and any conversion of 
the interest basis, may affect the secondary market in, and the market value of, such Exempt Notes as 
the change of interest basis may result in a lower interest return for Noteholders. Where the Exempt 
Notes convert from a fixed rate to a floating rate or the terms of the Exempt Notes otherwise provide 
for such conversion, the spread on the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes may be less favourable than then 
prevailing spreads on comparable Floating Rate Notes tied to the same reference rate. In addition, the 
new floating rate at any time may be lower than the rates on other Exempt Notes. Where the Exempt 
Notes convert from a floating rate to a fixed rate, the fixed rate may be lower than then prevailing rates 
on those Exempt Notes and could affect the market value of an investment in the relevant Notes. In the 
case of Subordinated Notes, the above considerations may be relevant notwithstanding that there is no 
change to the Margin used in the calculation of the applicable interest rate in these circumstances. 
Index Linked Notes and Dual Currency Notes 
The Issuer may issue Exempt Notes with principal or interest determined by reference to an index or 
formula, to movements in currency exchange rates or other factors (each, a "Relevant Factor"). In 
addition, the Issuer may issue Exempt Notes with principal or interest payable in one or more 
currencies which may be different from the currency in which the Exempt Notes are denominated. 
Potential investors should be aware that: 
(i) 
the market price of such Exempt Notes may be volatile; 
(ii) 
they may receive no interest; 
(iii) 
payment of principal or interest may occur at a different time or in a different currency than 
expected; 
(iv) 
they may lose all or a substantial portion of their principal; 
(v) 
a Relevant Factor may be subject to significant fluctuations that may not correlate with 
changes in interest rates, currencies or other indices; 
(vi) 
if a Relevant Factor is applied to Exempt Notes in conjunction with a multiplier greater than 
one or contains some other leverage factor, the effect of changes in the Relevant Factor on 
principal or interest payable likely will be magnified; and 
(vii) 
the timing of changes in a Relevant Factor may affect the actual yield to investors, even if the 
average level is consistent with their expectations. In general, the earlier the change in the 
Relevant Factor, the greater the effect on yield. 
The historical levels of an index should not be viewed as an indication of the future performance of 
such index during the term of any Index Linked Notes. 
Certain factors affecting the value and trading price of Index Linked Notes 
Generally, Index Linked Notes offer investment diversification opportunities, but there are some 
additional risks that may affect the value of the Exempt Notes before they mature. The interim or 
For personal use only
 
27 
market value of the Index Linked Notes may be affected by a number of factors, including but not 
limited to: 
(i) 
market interest rates; 
(ii) 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 
(iii) 
fluctuations in the prices of securities generally; 
(iv) 
the time remaining to any redemption date; and 
(v) 
economic, financial, regulatory, political, terrorist, military or other events in one or more 
jurisdictions, including factors affecting capital markets generally or the stock exchanges on 
which any Index Linked Notes may be traded. 
Additionally, the interim or market value of Index Linked Notes will vary with the price and/or level of 
the securities comprised in the relevant Index and is affected by a number of other factors, including but 
not limited to: 
(a) 
the value and volatility (frequency and magnitude of the changes in the level) of the 
relevant Index; 
(b) 
the dividend rate on any equity securities comprised in the relevant Index and the 
financial results and prospects of the issuer of those equity securities; 
(c) 
the liquidity of the securities comprised in the relevant Index in the secondary market; 
(d) 
changes that affect the Index, such as additions, deletions or substitutions of any 
securities comprised in the relevant index; and 
(e) 
economic, financial, regulatory, political, terrorist, military or other events in one or 
more jurisdictions, including factors affecting the stock exchange(s) on which any 
securities comprised in the relevant Index may be traded. 
Furthermore, the amounts payable under Index Linked Notes may not directly correlate to the rise 
and/or fall in level of any relevant Index. For example, Index Linked Notes may provide that any 
positive performance of any Index is subject to: 
(a) 
a percentage participation factor that is less than 100 per cent. of a price or level of 
such Index; 
(b) 
a cap or maximum amount; and/or 
(c) 
a negative spread or percentage deduction to a relevant price or level of such Index, 
which, in each case, would mean that the positive performance (if any) of such Index is not fully 
accounted for in any relevant payment(s) made under the Exempt Notes. 
Prospective investors should be experienced with respect to options and option transactions, should 
understand the additional risks set out above and should reach an investment decision only after 
carefully considering the suitability of Index Linked Notes in light of their particular financial 
circumstances, the information regarding the relevant Exempt Notes and the particular index (or basket 
of indices) to which the value of the relevant Exempt Notes may relate, as specified in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement. 
Before investing in Index Linked Notes, Noteholders should carefully consider, among other things, (a) 
the trading price of the relevant Exempt Notes, (b) the value and volatility of the relevant Index, (c) the 
time remaining to redemption of the Exempt Notes, (d) any changes in interim interest rates and 
dividend yields if applicable, (e) any changes in currency exchange rates if applicable, (f) the depth of 
the market or liquidity of any securities comprised in the relevant Index and (g) any related transaction 
costs.

28 
Index Linked Notes may be redeemed prior to their scheduled redemption date if an Additional 
Disruption Event occurs 
If an Additional Disruption Event (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) occurs, the Issuer 
will either (i) request the Calculation Agent to adjust the terms and conditions of the Index Linked 
Notes (without the consent of the Noteholders) or (ii) procure their early redemption, in each case, in 
accordance with the Conditions and the applicable Pricing Supplement. Prospective investors should be 
aware that depending on the terms and conditions of the Exempt Notes in question, the early cash 
settlement amount payable on any redemption may be less than the initial investment. Following any 
early redemption of Index Linked Notes, a Noteholder may not be able to reinvest the amount received 
at any effective interest rate as high as the interest rate or yield on the Exempt Notes being redeemed 
and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Investors in Index Linked Notes should 
consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that time. 
If Index Linked Notes are redeemed before their due date for redemption because an Additional 
Disruption Event occurs, the Issuer will take into account when determining the settlement amount, and 
may deduct from the settlement amount, an amount in respect of all costs, losses and expenses (if any) 
incurred (or expected to be incurred) by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the redemption of 
the Exempt Notes, including without duplication or limitation, hedging termination and funding 
breakage costs (whether actual or notional). Such costs, losses and expenses will reduce the amount 
received by Noteholders on redemption and may reduce the settlement amount to zero. The Issuer is not 
under any duty to hedge itself at all or in any particular manner, and is not required to hedge itself in a 
manner that would (or may be expected to) result in the lowest costs, losses and expenses. 
Principal protected Index Linked Notes are only principal protected to the extent that the Exempt Notes 
are held to maturity. Consequently, if principal protected Index Linked Notes are redeemed early 
Noteholders may lose some or all of their principal. 
Disrupted Days and Disruption Events 
Where the Calculation Agent determines that a day on which a valuation or determination is to be made 
is a disrupted day or that a relevant disruption event (including, for example, where an Index Exchange 
or Related Index Exchange fails to open on a Valuation Date or an Averaging Date, as applicable) has 
occurred, any such determination may have an effect on the timing of the valuation or determination 
and consequently may adversely affect the value of the relevant Index Linked Notes and/or may delay 
settlement of the Exempt Notes. Prospective investors should review the relevant conditions of the 
Index Linked Notes and the applicable Pricing Supplement to ascertain whether and how such 
provisions apply to any Exempt Notes they are considering purchasing. 
Furthermore, if the calculation of an Index is discontinued or suspended, it may become difficult to 
determine the value of the Exempt Notes and the Calculation Agent may, inter alia, make a good faith 
estimate in its sole discretion of the value the Index would have had at a certain Valuation Date. 
Valuation of Index Linked Notes: commissions and/or fees 
Prospective investors in Index Linked Notes should be aware that the issue price and/or offer price may 
include commissions and/or other fees (e.g. subscription fees, placement fees, direction fees, structuring 
fees and/or additional costs or inducements) paid by the Issuer to distributors as payment for 
distribution services. This can cause a difference between the theoretical value of the Exempt Notes and 
any bid and offer prices quoted by the Issuer or any third party. Any such difference may have an 
adverse effect on the value of the Exempt Notes, particularly immediately following the Offer and the 
Issue Date of such Exempt Notes, where any such fees and/or costs may be deducted from the price at 
which such Exempt Notes can be sold by the initial investor in the secondary market. 
Information on the amount of these inducements, commissions and fees will be included in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement and/or may be obtained from the Issuer or relevant distributor upon 
request.

29 
Hedging 
Prospective investors intending to purchase Index Linked Notes to hedge against the market risk 
associated with investing in an index (or basket of indices) should recognise the complexities of 
utilising Exempt Notes in this manner. For example, the value of the Index Linked Notes may not 
exactly correlate with the level of the relevant Index. Due to fluctuating supply and demand for the 
Exempt Notes there is no assurance that their value will correlate with movements in the level of the 
relevant Index. For these reasons, among others, it may not be possible to purchase or liquidate Index 
Linked Notes in a portfolio at the prices used to calculate the level of any Index. 
The issuer of a security comprised in an index could take actions that may adversely affect an Index 
Linked Note 
The issuer of a security comprised in an index referenced in the terms and conditions of an Index 
Linked Note will have no obligation to the Noteholder and may take actions, such as a merger or sale of 
assets, without regard to the interests of the Noteholder. Any such action could adversely affect the 
value of an Exempt Note linked to the index of which that security is a component. 
Exempt Notes with a multiplier or other leverage factor can be volatile investments 
Exempt Notes with variable interest rates can be volatile investments. If they are structured to include 
multipliers or other leverage factors, or caps or floors, or any combination of those features or other 
similar related features, their market values may be even more volatile than those for securities that do 
not include those features. 
Inverse Floating Rate Notes 
Inverse Floating Rate Notes (which are only applicable in the case of Unsubordinated Notes) have an 
interest rate equal to a fixed rate minus a rate based upon a reference rate such as LIBOR. The market 
values of those Exempt Notes typically are more volatile than market values of other conventional 
floating rate debt securities based on the same reference rate (and with otherwise comparable terms). 
Inverse Floating Rate Notes are more volatile because an increase in the reference rate not only 
decreases the interest rate of the Exempt Notes, but may also reflect an increase in prevailing interest 
rates, which further adversely affects the market value of these Exempt Notes. 
Exempt Notes which are issued at a substantial discount or premium may experience price volatility in 
response to changes in market interest rates 
The market values of securities issued at a substantial discount (such as Zero Coupon Notes) or 
premium to their principal amount tend to fluctuate more in relation to general changes in interest rates 
than do prices for more conventional interest-bearing securities. Generally, the longer the remaining 
term of such securities, the greater the price volatility as compared to more conventional interest-
bearing securities with comparable maturities. 
Future discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of Floating Rate Notes, Fixed Reset 
Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes which reference LIBOR, and other regulation and reform of 
"benchmarks" may adversely affect the value of Notes linked to or referencing such "benchmarks" 
The sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active 
underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for 
market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On 27 July 2017, and in a subsequent 
speech by its Chief Executive on 12 July 2018, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the 
FCA), which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit 
rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the FCA Announcements). The FCA 
Announcements indicated that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be 
guaranteed after 2021.  
In addition, on 29 November 2018, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that, from January 
2018, its Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates has been mandated with implementing 
a broad-based transition from Sterling LIBOR to Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) over 
the next four years across sterling bond, loan and derivative markets, so that SONIA is established as 
For personal use only
 
30 
the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021 (see also The market continues to 
develop in relation to SONIA as a reference rate below). 
Separate workstreams are also underway in Europe to reform EURIBOR using a hybrid methodology 
and to provide a fallback by reference to a euro risk-free rate (based on a euro overnight risk-free rate as 
adjusted by a methodology to create a term rate). On 13 September 2018, the working group on euro 
risk-free rates recommended Euro Short-Term Rate (STR) as the new risk free rate. STR is 
expected to be published by the ECB by October 2019. In addition, on 21 January 2019, the euro risk 
free-rate working group published a set of guiding principles for fallback provisions in new euro 
denominated cash products (including bonds). The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that 
continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts may increase the risk to the euro area financial 
system. 
In addition to these announcements, there have been other recent national and international regulatory 
guidance and proposals for reform of interest rates and indices which are deemed to be benchmarks, 
including LIBOR, EURIBOR and SONIA. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others 
are still to be implemented. These reforms could include, among other things, reforms to other 
benchmarks similar to those reforms announced in relation to LIBOR, and any such reforms may 
cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other 
consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect 
on the value or liquidity of, and return on, any Floating Rate Notes, Fixed Reset Notes, Index Linked 
Interest Notes or any other Exempt Notes which are linked to or reference a benchmark.   
The Benchmarks Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 29 June 2016 and 
applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, from 1 January 2018.  The Benchmarks Regulation 
applies to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a "benchmark" and the use of a 
"benchmark" within the EU. Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be 
authorised or registered (or, if non-EU based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise 
recognised or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of "benchmarks" of 
administrators that are not authorised or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or 
recognised or endorsed).  
The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on any Exempt Notes linked to or 
referencing a "benchmark", in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the "benchmark" are 
changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, 
among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the 
published rate or level of the "benchmark". 
More broadly, any of the international or national reforms (including those announced in relation to 
LIBOR and the application of any similar reforms to other "benchmarks"), or the general increased 
regulatory scrutiny of "benchmarks", could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise 
participating in the setting of a "benchmark" and complying with any such regulations or requirements. 
It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA and 
such other benchmarks will continue to be supported going forwards. This may cause LIBOR, 
EURIBOR, SONIA and such other "benchmarks" to perform differently than they have done in the 
past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have (without 
limitation) the following effects on certain "benchmarks": (i) discouraging market participants from 
continuing to administer or contribute to a "benchmark"; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or 
methodologies used in the "benchmark" and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the "benchmark". 
Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national 
reforms or other initiatives or investigations, could have a material adverse effect on the value of and 
return on any Exempt Notes linked to, referencing, or otherwise dependent (in whole or in part) upon, a 
"benchmark". 
Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the 
potential risks imposed by the Benchmarks Regulation reforms in making any investment decision with 
respect to any Exempt Notes linked to or referencing a "benchmark". 
For personal use only
 
31 
Investors should be aware that in the case of Floating Rate Notes, Fixed Reset Notes and Index Linked 
Interest Notes, the Conditions of the Exempt Notes provide for certain fallback arrangements in the 
event that a published Benchmark, including an inter-bank offered rate such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, 
SONIA or other relevant reference rates ceases to exist or be published or another Benchmark Event 
occurs. These fallback arrangements include the possibility that the Rate of Interest could be 
determined by reference to a Successor Rate or an Alternative Rate and that an Adjustment Spread may 
be applied to such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate as a result of the replacement of the relevant 
"benchmark" or screen rate (as applicable) originally specified with the Successor Rate or the 
Alternative Rate (as the case may be), together with the making of certain Benchmark Amendments to 
the Conditions of such Exempt Notes, which in the case of any Alternative Rate, any Adjustment 
Spread unless formally recommended or provided for and any Benchmark Amendments shall be 
determined by the Issuer (acting in good faith and by reference to such sources as it deems appropriate, 
which may include consultation with an Independent Adviser). Any Adjustment Spread that is applied 
may not be effective to reduce or eliminate economic prejudice to investors. The use of a Successor 
Rate or Alternative Rate (including with the application of an Adjustment Spread) will still result in any 
Notes linked to or referencing a benchmark performing differently (which may include payment of a 
lower Rate of Interest) than they would if the relevant benchmark were to continue to apply in its 
current form. 
In certain circumstances the ultimate fallback for the purposes of calculation of interest for a particular 
Interest Period or Reset Period (as the case may be) may result in the Rate of Interest for the last 
preceding Interest Period or Reset Period being used. This may result in the effective application of a 
fixed rate for Floating Rate Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes based on the rate which was last 
observed on the Relevant Screen Page or, in the case of Fixed Reset Notes, the application of the Reset 
Rate for a preceding Reset Period or the initial Rate of Interest applicable to such Notes on the Interest 
Commencement Date. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of any Successor 
Rate or Alternative Rate, any determinations that may need to be made by the Issuer and the 
involvement of any Independent Adviser, the relevant fallback provisions may not operate as intended 
at the relevant time. 
Any such consequences could have a material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of and return on 
any such Exempt Notes. Moreover, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the 
setting or existence of any relevant reference rate could affect the ability of the Issuer to meet its 
obligations under the Floating Rate Notes, Fixed Reset Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes or could 
have a material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Floating 
Rate Notes, Fixed Reset Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes. Investors should consider these matters 
when making their investment decision with respect to the relevant Floating Rate Notes,Fixed Reset 
Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes. 
The market continues to develop in relation to SONIA as a reference rate 
Where the applicable Pricing Supplement for a series of Floating Rate Notes specifies that the interest 
rate for such Floating Rate Notes will be determined by reference to SONIA, interest will be 
determined on the basis of Compounded Daily SONIA (as defined in the Conditions of the Exempt 
Notes). Compounded Daily SONIA differs from Sterling LIBOR in a number of material respects, 
including (without limitation) that Compounded Daily SONIA is a backwards-looking, compounded, 
risk-free overnight rate, whereas Sterling LIBOR is expressed on the basis of a forward-looking term 
and includes a credit risk-element based on inter-bank lending. As such, investors should be aware that 
Sterling LIBOR and SONIA may behave materially differently as interest reference rates for Floating 
Rate Notes. The use of SONIA as a reference rate for Eurobonds is nascent, and is subject to change 
and development, both in terms of the substance of the calculation and in the development and adoption 
of market infrastructure for the issuance and trading of debt securities referencing SONIA. 
Accordingly, prospective investors in any Floating Rate Notes referencing Compounded Daily SONIA 
should be aware that the market continues to develop in relation to SONIA as a reference rate in the 
capital markets and its adoption as an alternative to Sterling LIBOR. For example, in the context of 
backwards-looking SONIA rates, market participants and relevant working groups are, as at the date of

this Information Memorandum, currently assessing the differences between compounded rates and 
weighted average rates, and such groups are also exploring forward-looking term SONIA reference 
rates (which seek to measure the markets forward expectation of an average SONIA rate over a 
designated term). The adoption of SONIA may also see component inputs into swap rates or other 
composite rates transferring from Sterling LIBOR or another reference rate to SONIA. 
The market or a significant part thereof may adopt an application of SONIA that differs significantly 
from that set out in the Conditions in the case of Floating Rate Notes issued under this Programme for 
which Compounded Daily SONIA is specified as being applicable in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement. Furthermore, the Issuer may in the future issue Floating Rate Notes referencing SONIA 
that differ materially in terms of the interest determination provisions when compared with the 
provisions for such determination as set out in Condition 5(b)(5A) as contained in this Information 
Memorandum. The nascent development of Compounded Daily SONIA as an interest reference rate for 
the Eurobond markets, as well as continued development of SONIA-based rates for such market and the 
market infrastructure for adopting such rates, could result in reduced liquidity or increased volatility or 
could otherwise affect the market price of any SONIA-referenced Floating Rate Notes issued under the 
Programme from time to time.  
Furthermore, interest on Floating Rate Notes which reference Compounded Daily SONIA is only 
capable of being determined at the end of the relevant Observation Period (as defined in Condition 
5(b)(5A)) and immediately prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. It may be difficult for investors 
in Floating Rate Notes which reference Compounded Daily SONIA to estimate reliably the amount of 
interest which will be payable on such Floating Rate Notes, and some investors may be unable or 
unwilling to trade such Floating Rate Notes without changes to their IT systems, both of which factors 
could adversely impact the liquidity of such Floating Rate Notes. Further, in contrast to Sterling 
LIBOR-based Floating Rate Notes, if Floating Rate Notes referencing Compounded Daily SONIA 
become due and payable as a result of an event of default under Condition 11, or are otherwise 
redeemed early on a date which is not an Interest Payment Date, the final rate of interest payable in 
respect of such Floating Rate Notes shall only be determined immediately prior to the date on which the 
Floating Rate Notes become due and payable. 
In addition, the manner of adoption or application of SONIA reference rates in the Eurobond markets 
may differ materially compared with the application and adoption of SONIA in other markets, such as 
the derivatives and loan markets. Investors should carefully consider how any mismatch between the 
adoption of SONIA reference rates across these markets may impact any hedging or other financial 
arrangements which they may put in place in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposal of 
Floating Rate Notes referencing Compounded Daily SONIA. 
Investors should carefully consider these matters when making their investment decision with respect to 
any such Floating Rate Notes. 
Risks related to Exempt Notes generally 
Set out below is a description of material risks relating to the Exempt Notes generally: 
Investments in Exempt Notes are not deposit liabilities or protected accounts under the Banking Act 
Investments in Exempt Notes are an investment in the Issuer and may be affected by the on-going 
performance, financial position and solvency of the Issuer. Exempt Notes are not deposit liabilities or 
protected accounts under the Banking Act. Therefore, Exempt Notes are not guaranteed or insured by 
any Australian government, government agency or compensation scheme of Australia or any other 
jurisdiction. 
Insolvency laws 
In the event that the Issuer becomes insolvent, insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer will be 
governed by Australian law. Potential investors should be aware that Australian insolvency laws are 
different from the insolvency laws in other jurisdictions. In particular, the voluntary administration 
procedure under the Corporations Act, which provides for the potential re-organisation of an insolvent 
company, differs significantly from similar provisions under the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. 
For personal use only

Noteholders ability to enforce certain rights in connection with the Exempt Notes may be limited or 
affected by reforms to Australian insolvency legislation relating to ipso facto rights. 
On 18 September 2017 the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 2) Act 2017 
(the Treasury Act) received Royal Assent and was enacted. The Treasury Act contains reforms to 
Australian insolvency laws. Under the Treasury Act, any right under a contract, agreement or 
arrangement (such as a right entitling a creditor to terminate a contract or to accelerate a payment under 
a contract) arising merely because a company, among other circumstances, is under administration, has 
appointed a managing controller or is the subject of an application under section 411 of the 
Corporations Act (i.e. ipso facto rights), will not be enforceable during a prescribed moratorium 
period. 
The Treasury Act took effect on 1 July 2018 and applies to ipso facto rights arising under contracts, 
agreements or arrangements entered into at or after that date, subject to certain exclusions. On 21 June 
2018, the Australian Government introduced the Corporations Amendment (Stay on Enforcing Certain 
Rights) Regulations 2018 (the Regulations) which sets out the types of contracts that will be excluded 
from the operation of the stay on the enforcement of ipso facto rights. The draft Regulations indicate 
that a contract, agreement or arrangement under which a company incorporated in Australia issues or 
may issue securities such as the Exempt Notes may be exempt from the moratorium. 
The Regulations provide that a contract, agreement or arrangement that is, or governs securities, 
financial products, bonds or promissory notes will be exempt from the moratorium. Furthermore, a 
contract, agreement or arrangement under which a party is or may be liable to subscribe for, or to 
procure subscribers for, securities, financial products, bonds or promissory notes is also excluded from 
the stay. Accordingly, the Regulations should exclude the Exempt Notes and certain other arrangements 
under the Programme from the stay. However, as the Act and the Regulations are new to the insolvency 
regime in Australia, they have not been the subject of judicial interpretation. If the Regulations are 
determined not to exclude the Exempt Notes or any other arrangements relating to the Programme, 
from their operation under the exclusions mentioned above or any other exclusion under the 
Regulations, this may render unenforceable in Australia provisions of the Exempt Notes or the 
Programme conditioned solely on the occurrence of events giving rise to ipso facto rights. 
The conditions of the Exempt Notes contain provisions which may permit their modification without the 
consent of all investors. 
The Conditions of the Exempt Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider 
matters affecting their interests generally, including modifications of the Conditions. These provisions 
permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at 
the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority and therefore 
there is no guarantee that the resolutions approved will be consistent with the interests and/or the votes 
cast by each Noteholder. 
Modifications may also be made to the Conditions without the consent of Noteholders if such 
modifications are, in the opinion of the Issuer (a) of a formal, minor or technical nature, (b) made to 
cure any ambiguity or correct any manifest error or (c) not materially prejudicial to the interests of 
Noteholders (subject as provided in Condition 13 where an Extraordinary Resolution of Noteholders is 
required). 
In the case of Subordinated Notes, the Issuer may further modify the Conditions if the Issuer is of the 
opinion such modification is (i) necessary or expedient for the purposes of facilitating a substitution in 
accordance with Condition 14(b), (ii) made to amend any date or time period stated, required or 
permitted in connection with any redemption or Exchange or (iii) made to alter the terms of any 
Subordinated Notes to align them with subsequent issues of Relevant Tier 2 Securities or the definitions 
of "Relevant Tier 1 Securities" or "Relevant Tier 2 Securities" on account of subsequent issues of 
capital instruments of the Group, provided in the case of (iii) that such modification is not materially 
prejudicial to the interests of Noteholders. 
Certain amendments to Subordinated Notes may require prior written approval from APRA. Such 
approval is at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given. 
For personal use only
 
34 
Substitution of the Issuer 
If the conditions set out in the Conditions of the Exempt Notes are met, the Issuer may, without the 
consent or sanction of the Noteholders, substitute in its place a new issuer as debtor in respect of all 
obligations arising under or in connection with the Exempt Notes (the "Substituted Company"). In that 
case, the Noteholders will also assume the insolvency risk with regard to the Substituted Company. 
In the case of Subordinated Notes, the Issuer may substitute for itself a NOHC as the issuer of ordinary 
shares on Exchange or, if so specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, as the debtor in respect of 
the Subordinated Notes. If a NOHC is substituted as the debtor in respect of the Subordinated Notes it 
means that a holder of Subordinated Notes would no longer have rights against the Issuer. If a NOHC is 
substituted as the issuer of ordinary shares on Exchange it means that a holder of Subordinated Notes 
will receive ordinary shares in the NOHC rather than the Issuer. 
Although not currently contemplated, the implementation of a NOHC structure may involve the Issuer 
selling some but not all of its business, and other subsidiaries, to the NOHC or a subsidiary of the 
NOHC. As a result, the profits and net asset position of the Issuer and the NOHC may be different to 
that of the Issuer prior to the NOHC structure being implemented. 
The value of the Exempt Notes could be adversely affected by a change in English law or administrative 
practice 
The Conditions of the Exempt Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of this 
Information Memorandum. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision 
or change to English law or administrative practice after the date of this Information Memorandum. 
Any such change could materially adversely impact the value of any Exempt Notes affected by it. 
Investors who hold less than the minimum Specified Denomination may be unable to sell their Exempt 
Notes and may be adversely affected if definitive Exempt Notes are subsequently required to be issued 
In relation to any issue of Exempt Notes which have denominations consisting of a minimum Specified 
Denomination plus one or more higher integral multiples of another smaller amount, it is possible that 
such Exempt Notes may be traded in amounts in excess of the minimum Specified Denomination that 
are not integral multiples of such minimum Specified Denomination. In such a case a holder who, as a 
result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the minimum Specified 
Denomination in his account with the relevant clearing system would not be able to sell the remainder 
of such holding without first purchasing a principal amount of Exempt Notes at or in excess of the 
minimum Specified Denomination such that its holding amounts to a Specified Denomination. Further, 
a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less than the minimum 
Specified Denomination in his account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not 
receive a definitive Exempt Note in respect of such holding (should definitive Exempt Notes be printed 
or issued) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Exempt Notes at or in excess of the 
minimum Specified Denomination such that its holding amounts to a Specified Denomination. 
If such Exempt Notes in definitive form are issued, holders should be aware that definitive Exempt 
Notes which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of the minimum Specified 
Denomination may be illiquid and difficult to trade. 
The Exempt Notes will not have any covenant restricting the incurrence of liens for the benefit of other 
external indebtedness of the Issuer 
As at the date of this Information Memorandum, a significant amount of the Issuers long term 
indebtedness has the benefit of a covenant that the Issuer will not create or have outstanding any 
mortgage, pledge or other charge, upon or with respect to, any of its present or future assets or revenues 
to secure repayment of, or to secure any guarantee or indemnity in respect of, any "external 
indebtedness" (as defined below) without according the same to the holders of that long term 
indebtedness. This covenant has not been given for the benefit of holders of any Exempt Notes issued 
under the Programme the terms and conditions of which are contained in the Programme Circular dated 
13 October 2011 or any Information Memorandum published by the Issuer after this date and will not 
For personal use only
 
35 
be given for the benefit of the holders of any Exempt Notes, the terms and conditions of which are 
those contained in this Information Memorandum. 
As used in the previous paragraph, "external indebtedness" means any obligation for the repayment of 
borrowed money in the form of or represented by bonds, notes, debentures or other securities: 
(a) 
which are initially offered outside the Commonwealth of Australia with the consent of the 
Issuer in an amount exceeding 50 per cent. of the aggregate nominal amount of the relevant 
issue; and 
(b) 
which are, or are capable of being, quoted, listed or ordinarily traded on any stock exchange or 
on any recognised securities market. 
Risks related to the market generally 
Set out below is a description of material market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, 
interest rate risk and credit risk: 
An active secondary market in respect of the Exempt Notes may never be established or may be illiquid 
and this would adversely affect the value at which an investor could sell its Exempt Notes 
Exempt Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a 
market for the Exempt Notes does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be 
able to sell their Exempt Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to 
similar investments that have a developed secondary market at prices higher than the relevant investors 
initial investment. Therefore, in establishing their investment strategy, investors should ensure that the 
term of the Exempt Notes is in line with their future liquidity requirements. This is particularly the case 
for Exempt Notes that are especially sensitive to interest rate, currency or market risks, are designed for 
specific investment objectives or strategies or have been structured to meet the investment requirements 
of limited categories of investors. These types of Exempt Notes generally would have a more limited 
secondary market and more price volatility than conventional debt securities. Each of the Issuer and any 
Dealer may, but is not obliged to, at any time purchase Exempt Notes at any price in the open market or 
by tender or private treaty. To the extent that an issue of Exempt Notes becomes illiquid, an investor 
may have to hold the relevant Exempt Notes until maturity before it is able to realise value. 
The Issuer may, but is not obliged to, list an issue of Exempt Notes on a stock exchange. If Exempt 
Notes are not listed or traded on any exchange, pricing information for the relevant Exempt Notes may 
be more difficult to obtain and the liquidity of such Exempt Notes may be adversely affected. 
The secondary market price of any Exempt Notes immediately following their issue may be less than 
the Issue Price/Offer Price. 
If Exempt Notes are not listed on a regulated market, they may be traded on trading systems governed 
by the laws and regulations in force from time to time (e.g. multilateral trading systems or "MTF") or in 
other trading systems (e.g. bilateral systems, or equivalent trading systems). Trading in such Exempt 
Notes may take place outside the above-mentioned trading systems, with possible risks as to the 
transparency of the determination of prices. Investors should note that the Issuer does not grant any 
warranty to Noteholders as to the methodologies used to determine the price of Exempt Notes which 
are traded outside a trading system, however, where the Issuer or any of their affiliates determine the 
price of such Exempt Notes, they will take into account the market parameters applicable at such time 
in accordance with applicable provisions of law. 
In the case of unlisted Exempt Notes (i) subject to optional redemption by the Issuer and (ii) where 
principal or interest is determined by reference to an index or formula, to changes in the prices of 
securities or commodities, to movements in currency exchange rates or other factors ("Unlisted Callable 
Structured Notes"), the Issuer may from time to time publish on a screen page of a commercial 
quotation service or on such other basis as it may advise the relevant Dealers an indication of the 
charges it may apply on any purchase by it of such Unlisted Callable Structured Notes. 
Any such publication is in the Issuers sole and absolute discretion and the Issuer may subsequently 
change any indicative charge so published or cease such publication at any time and for any reason. No 
For personal use only
 
36 
such publication will constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell any Unlisted Callable 
Structured Notes or represent any undertaking or other commitment by the Issuer to purchase any 
Unlisted Callable Structured Notes and any actual charge applied by the Issuer on any purchase of 
Unlisted Callable Structured Notes by it may be greater or less than any indicative charge published. the 
Issuer will not at any time purchase any Unlisted Callable Structured Exempt Notes from any 
Noteholder in any jurisdiction in which such purchase is unlawful and the Issuer may decide not to 
purchase Unlisted Callable Structured Notes at any time and for any reason. 
Any charge the Issuer may apply on any purchase of Unlisted Callable Structured Notes will be only 
one of the relevant considerations in determining the purchase price of the relevant Unlisted Callable 
Structured Notes and other relevant factors may include, without limitation, the weighted average life 
of the Unlisted Callable Structured Notes and the cost to the Issuer of unwinding any underlying and/or 
related hedging and funding arrangements. The determination of such factors and any price at which the 
Issuer may purchase any Unlisted Callable Structured Notes will be in the sole and absolute discretion 
of the Issuer. 
Investors should note that a secondary market may be affected by both legal restrictions in certain 
jurisdictions and by the Issuer and/or any Dealer purchasing or holding Exempt Notes. 
Investors may receive less in the secondary market than their initial investment 
If it is possible to sell Exempt Notes, they would be sold for the prevailing bid price in the market and 
may be subject to a transaction fee. The prevailing bid price may be affected by several factors 
including the performance of any Index to which payments under the Exempt Notes are linked, 
prevailing interest rates at the time of sale, the time left before the stated maturity date and the 
creditworthiness of the Issuer. It is therefore possible that an investor selling Exempt Notes in the 
secondary market may receive a price less than the investors initial investment in the relevant Exempt 
Notes. 
Impact of implicit fees on the Issue/Offer Price of the Exempt Notes 
Investors should note that implicit fees (e.g. placement fees, direction fees, structuring fees) may be a 
component of the Issue/Offer Price of Exempt Notes, but such fees will not be taken into account for 
the purposes of determining the price of such Exempt Notes in the secondary market. 
The Issuer will specify in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the type and amount of any implicit fees 
which are applicable from time to time. 
Investors should also take into consideration that if Exempt Notes are sold on the secondary market 
immediately following the offer period relating to such Exempt Notes, the implicit fees included in the 
Issue/Offer Price on initial subscription for such Exempt Notes will be deducted from the price at which 
such Exempt Notes may be sold in the secondary market. 
If an investor holds Exempt Notes which are not denominated in the investors home currency, that 
investor will be exposed to movements in exchange rates adversely affecting the value of his holding.  
In addition, the imposition of exchange controls in relation to any Exempt Notes could result in an 
investor not receiving payments on those Exempt Notes. 
The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Exempt Notes in the Specified Currency. This presents 
certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investors financial activities are denominated 
principally in a currency or currency unit (the "Investors Currency") other than the Specified Currency. 
These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to 
devaluation of the Specified Currency or revaluation of the Investors Currency) and the risk that 
authorities with jurisdiction over the Investors Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An 
appreciation in the value of the Investors Currency relative to the Specified Currency would decrease 
(1) the Investors Currency-equivalent yield on the Exempt Notes, (2) the Investors Currency-
equivalent value of the principal payable on the Exempt Notes and (3) the Investors Currency-
equivalent market value of the Exempt Notes. 
Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls 
that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuer to make payments in 
For personal use only
 
37 
respect of the Exempt Notes. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, 
or no interest or principal. 
The above risks may be increased if any Specified Currency and/or an Investors Currency is the 
currency of an emerging market jurisdiction. 
The value of Fixed Rate Notes may be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates 
Investment in Fixed Rate Notes involves the risk that if market interest rates subsequently increase 
above the rate paid on the Fixed Rate Notes, this will adversely affect the value of the Fixed Rate 
Notes. 
Credit ratings assigned to the Issuer or any Exempt Notes may not reflect all the risks associated with 
an investment in those Exempt Notes 
One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Issuer or the Exempt 
Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, 
additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Exempt Notes. A 
credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or 
withdrawn by the rating agency at any time (including as a result of any change in rating methodology). 
In addition actual or anticipated changes in the credit ratings of the Exempt Notes will generally affect 
any trading for, or trading value of, the Exempt Notes. 
Changes in any applicable tax law or practice may have an adverse effect on a Noteholder 
Any relevant tax law or practice applicable as at the date of this Information Memorandum and/or the 
date of purchase or subscription of any Exempt Notes may change at any time (including during any 
subscription period or the term of any Exempt Notes). Any such change may have an adverse effect on 
a Noteholder, including that Exempt Notes may be redeemed before their due date, their liquidity may 
decrease and/or the tax treatment of amounts payable or receivable by or to an affected Noteholder may 
be less than otherwise expected by such Noteholder. 
In the case of Subordinated Notes, any redemption as a result of changes in relevant tax law is also 
subject to the further considerations described in "Risks specific to Subordinated Notes  The 
Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer" below. 
Potential conflicts of interest 
Where the Calculation Agent is an affiliate of the Issuer, potential conflicts of interest may exist 
between the Calculation Agent and Noteholders, including with respect to certain determinations and 
judgements that the Calculation Agent may make pursuant to the Exempt Notes that may influence the 
amount receivable or specified assets deliverable on redemption of the Exempt Notes. 
The Issuer and/or any of its affiliates may from time to time engage in transactions involving securities 
comprised in indices to which payments under the Exempt Notes are linked for their proprietary 
accounts or for other accounts under their management, subject to requirements of the Securities Act. 
The Issuer and/or its affiliates may also issue other derivative instruments in respect of any such 
securities. The Issuer and/or its affiliates may also act as underwriter in connection with future offerings 
of shares or other securities related to an issue of Exempt Notes or may act as financial adviser to 
certain companies or companies whose shares are included in a basket of shares or in a commercial 
banking capacity for such companies. These activities may have a positive or negative effect on the 
value of the relevant securities and consequently upon the value of the Exempt Notes. 
The Issuer and any Dealer may at the date hereof or at any time hereafter, be in possession of 
information in relation to an Index or any security comprised in an Index that is or may be material in 
the context of the Exempt Notes and may or may not be publicly available to Noteholders. There is no 
obligation on the Issuer or any Dealer to disclose to Noteholders any such information. 
The Issuer and/or any of its affiliates may have existing or future business relationships with the 
sponsors of an Index and/or the issuers of securities comprised in an Index (including, but not limited 
to, lending, depositary, risk management, advisory and banking relationships), and will pursue actions 
For personal use only
 
38 
and take steps that they or it deems necessary or appropriate to protect their and/or its interests arising 
therefrom without regard to the consequences for a Noteholder. 
Where Exempt Notes are offered to potential investors, as the relevant Manager(s)/Dealer and any 
distributors act pursuant to a mandate granted by the Issuer and they receive fees on the basis of the 
services performed and the outcome of the placement of such Exempt Notes, potential conflicts of 
interest could arise. 
Any further risk factors relating to additional conflicts of interest with respect to a particular issue of the 
Exempt Notes will be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. 
Risks specific to Subordinated Notes 
Set out below is a description of the principal risks which may be relevant to an investor in 
Subordinated Notes. See Conditions 21 and 22 for further information on any potential Exchange or 
Write Down of Subordinated Notes, including for the definitions of various terms used in this section: 
The Issuers obligations under Subordinated Notes are subordinated 
The Issuers obligations under Subordinated Notes will be unsecured and subordinated and will rank 
after the claims of holders of Senior Ranking Obligations, including claims preferred by applicable laws 
and equally with the claims of holders of Equal Ranking Securities. "Senior Ranking Obligations" 
means all present and future deposits and other liabilities, securities and other obligations of the Issuer 
which would be entitled to be admitted in the winding up of the Issuer (and including but not limited to 
obligations in respect of instruments issued before 1 January 2013 as Tier 2 Capital) other than Equal 
Ranking Securities and Junior Ranking Securities. Although Subordinated Notes may pay a higher rate 
of interest than comparable Notes which are not subordinated, there is a real risk that a holder of 
Subordinated Notes will lose all or some of its investment should the Issuer become insolvent. 
In addition, on Exchange, holders of Subordinated Notes will become holders of Ordinary Shares and 
rank equally with other holders of Ordinary Shares. 
Insolvency laws 
If an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order successfully appealed or 
permanently stayed within 30 Business Days), or an effective resolution is passed, for the winding up of 
the Issuer in Australia (but not elsewhere) Subordinated Notes are immediately due and payable for an 
amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest up to (but 
excluding) the date of commencement of the winding up. In a winding up of the Issuer, the claim of a 
holder of a Subordinated Note will rank after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations 
including claims preferred by applicable laws and equally with the claims of holders of Equal Ranking 
Securities as set out further in Condition 3(b). 
Following an Exchange, in the event the Issuer becomes insolvent, there may be insufficient assets to 
distribute to holders of Ordinary Shares once all of the Issuers creditors (both subordinated and 
unsubordinated) and preference shareholders have been repaid. 
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies the Issuer in writing that it believes: 
(a) 
an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of 
capital instruments of the Group, is necessary because, without it, the Issuer would 
become non-viable; or 
(b) 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, 
without it, the Issuer would become non-viable.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer must immediately Exchange such number of 
Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) 
as specified by APRA or necessary to satisfy APRA that the Issuer will no longer be non-viable. In the 
case of a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, all Subordinated Notes must be 
Exchanged. The Exchange will be irrevocable. 
For personal use only
 
39 
If Subordinated Notes are Exchanged following the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event, the 
number of Ordinary Shares received is limited to the Maximum Exchange Number. There is a risk that 
holders of Subordinated Notes will receive a number of Ordinary Shares with a value significantly less 
than the Outstanding Principal Amount. 
If for any reason the Exchange is not effective and the Issuer has not otherwise issued Ordinary Shares 
within five Ordinary Shares Business Days after the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger 
Event, then the holders of Subordinated Notes rights (including to payment of the then Outstanding 
Principal Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes 
or percentage of the then Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes are immediately and 
irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of 
the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event. This could occur if the Issuer were prevented from 
issuing Ordinary Shares by circumstances outside its control, for example, if the Issuer were prevented 
by an applicable law or order of any court, or action of any government authority, from issuing 
Ordinary Shares.  Any write-down of Subordinated Notes would be permanent and holders of 
Subordinated Notes will have no further claim against the Issuer in respect of any Written-Down 
amount of Subordinated Notes.  
The circumstances that may give rise to a Non-Viability Trigger Event are unpredictable 
It should be noted that whether a Non-Viability Trigger Event will occur is at the discretion of APRA 
and there are currently no precedents for this. The circumstances in which APRA may exercise its 
discretion are not limited to when APRA may have a concern about a banks capital levels but may also 
include when APRA has a concern about a banks funding and liquidity levels. 
If one, or a combination, of general risks associated with the Issuers businesses (including those risks 
described under "Factors that may affect the Issuers ability to fulfil its obligations under Notes issued 
under the Programme") leads to a significant capital loss, or prolonged difficulties in raising funding or 
maintaining sufficient liquidity, the Issuer believes this may be the type of situation in which APRA 
becomes concerned and notifies the Issuer that it has become non-viable. 
Holders of Subordinated Notes will bear the risk of fluctuations in the price of Subordinated Notes and 
in the price of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange 
The market price of Subordinated Notes is expected to be affected by various factors, including: 
 
changes in Australian and international economic conditions, interest rates, credit margins, 
inflation rates and foreign exchange rates; 
 
the performance or financial position of the Issuer; 
 
movements in the market price of equity and/or other debt issued by the Issuer or by other issuers; 
 
changes in investor perceptions and sentiment in relation to the Issuer or the financial services 
industry; and 
 
other major Australian and international events such as hostilities and tensions, and acts of 
terrorism. 
If Exchange occurs, holders of Subordinated Notes will become holders of Ordinary Shares. Ordinary 
Shares are a different type of investment to Subordinated Notes. Dividends are payable at the absolute 
discretion of the Issuer and the amount of each dividend is discretionary (not subject to a formula). The 
market price of Ordinary Shares may be more sensitive than Subordinated Notes to changes in the 
Issuers performance, operational issues and other business issues. 
Ordinary Shares are currently quoted on ASX. While the Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to 
quote Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange on ASX, no assurance can be given that Ordinary Shares 
will be quoted on ASX at the time of Exchange and Holders of Subordinated Notes may not be able to 
sell their Ordinary Shares at all. 
The market price of Ordinary Shares is quoted on ASX in Australian Dollars. Any dividends paid or 
proceeds from the sale of Ordinary Shares will be in Australian Dollars (including where they are sold 
For personal use only
 
40 
by a nominee pursuant to Condition 22(j)). The exchange rate between an investors preferred currency 
and Australian Dollars may go up or down. These changes may be significant and an investor may 
incur fees in changing amounts received in Australian Dollars into the investors preferred currency. 
Compliance with applicable shareholding laws 
Certain legislation in Australia limits the acquisition by persons of interests in Ordinary Shares where 
the person acquires interests in Ordinary Shares in excess of limits permitted under the relevant Act. 
The relevant legislation is as follows: 
(a) 
Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act  Takeover and Substantial Shareholder Provisions 
The Issuer is a company listed on the ASX. Investors in Subordinated Notes should consider 
the possibility that they may be prohibited from receiving or acquiring Ordinary Shares on 
Exchange if as a result of such Exchange their voting power in the Issuer increases from 20 per 
cent. or below to more than 20 per cent., or from a starting point that is above 20 per cent. and 
below 90 per cent., unless the shares are acquired in a manner specifically permitted under an 
exception.  
In addition, under the Corporations Act, a person who has a substantial holding in an ASX 
listed company, such as the Issuer, is required to notify the Issuer and the ASX (in the 
prescribed form) disclosing its interests in the Issuer generally within 2 business days after the 
person becomes aware of the circumstances which give rise to the persons substantial 
holding. A person has a "substantial holding" in the Issuer if that person and its associates have 
relevant interests in voting shares to which 5 per cent. or more of the total votes attach, or if 
the person has made a takeover bid for the voting shares in the Issuer. 
Once a person becomes a substantial shareholder of the Issuer, that person is also obliged to 
notify the Issuer and the ASX (in the prescribed form) of its interest generally within 2 
business days after its voting power increases or decreases by 1 per cent. or more. That person 
is also required to notify the Issuer and the ASX (in the prescribed form) if that person ceases 
to have substantial holding in the Issuer. 
Investors should seek their own advice on the application of Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act 
to their own circumstances. 
(b) 
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 of Australia 
Foreign investors in Subordinated Notes should consider the possibility that their receipt or 
acquisition of Ordinary Shares may be subject to review and approval by the Treasurer of the 
Commonwealth of Australia (the "Treasurer") under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers 
Act 1975 of Australia (the "FATA Act"). 
The FATA Act applies to any acquisition of 15 per cent. or more of the outstanding shares of 
Australian companies or any acquisition which results in one foreign person (including a 
company) and any associated persons controlling 15 per cent. or more of the total voting 
power of an Australian company. The FATA Act requires any person proposing to make any 
such acquisition to first notify the Treasurer of that persons intention to do so. Where such an 
acquisition has already occurred, the Treasurer has the power to order that the acquired shares 
be disposed of. 
In addition, the FATA Act applies to any acquisition by two or more foreign persons and any 
associated persons controlling, in the aggregate, 40 per cent. or more of the total voting power 
or ownership. Where such an acquisition has occurred without notification to the Treasurer, 
the Treasurer has the power to order the disposal of the acquired shares. 
Investors should seek their own advice on the application of the FATA Act to their own 
circumstances. 
(c) 
Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 of Australia 
For personal use only
 
41 
Investors in Subordinated Notes should consider the possibility that they may be restricted 
from receiving or acquiring Ordinary Shares under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 
1998 of Australia (the "FSSA"). Under the FSSA, a person (including a company) must not 
acquire any interest in an Australian financial sector company (such as the Issuer) where the 
acquisition would take that persons voting power (which includes the voting power of the 
persons associates) in the financial sector company to more than 15 per cent. The concept of 
"voting power" is very broadly defined. The Australian Treasurer may approve a higher 
percentage limit on national interest grounds. Furthermore, even if a person holds less than 15 
per cent. of the voting power of a financial sector company, the Treasurer has the power to 
declare that a person has "practical control" of that company and require the person to 
relinquish that control. 
Investors should seek their own advice on the application of the FSSA to their own 
circumstances. 
(d) 
Part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 of Australia 
Investors in Subordinated Notes should consider the possibility that they may be restricted 
from receiving or acquiring Ordinary Shares under the Part IV of the Competition and 
Consumer Act 2010 of Australia (the "CCA"). Under the CCA a person (including a company) 
may not acquire shares in an Australian company if the acquisition has the effect, or is likely to 
have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market in Australia, or a state or 
territory thereof. 
Investors should seek their own advice on the application of the CCA to their own 
circumstances. 
Where a holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder because of the legislation 
described in paragraphs (i)-(iv) above, the Ordinary Shares will be issued to a nominee who will, at the 
first opportunity, sell the Ordinary Shares and pay the net proceeds of the sale, after deducting any 
applicable brokerage, stamp duty and other taxes, to the holder of Subordinated Notes. If for any reason 
the Issuer has not otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the nominee within five Ordinary Shares 
Business Days, then the rights of holders of the Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the then 
Outstanding Principal Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such 
Subordinated Notes or percentage of the then Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes 
are immediately and irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have occurred 
immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer 
Subject, as further described in the Conditions, to (i) the Issuer replacing Subordinated Notes with a 
capital instrument which is of the same or better quality than Subordinated Notes, and the replacement 
being done under conditions that are sustainable for the income capacity of the Issuer, or obtaining 
confirmation from APRA that APRA is satisfied, having regard to the capital position of the Issuer and 
the Group, that the Issuer does not have to replace Subordinated Notes and (ii) APRA having given its 
prior written approval, the Issuer may at its option: 
 
redeem all or, if so provided, some of the Subordinated Notes for their Optional Redemption 
Amount together with any accrued but unpaid interest on the Optional Redemption Date(s);  
 
redeem all (but not some) of the Subordinated Notes for their Early Redemption Amount together 
with any accrued but unpaid interest as at the date fixed for redemption at any time after the Issue 
Date if the Issuer receives an opinion from reputable legal counsel or other tax adviser in Australia, 
experienced in such matters, to the effect that there is a material risk that as a result of a change in 
laws of Australia (including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment 
which has been or will be introduced) the Issuer would be exposed to a more than de minimis 
adverse tax consequence in relation to the Subordinated Notes other than a tax consequence the 
Issuer expected as at the Issue Date; and  
For personal use only
 
42 
 
redeem all (but not some) of the Subordinated Notes for their Early Redemption Amount together 
with any accrued but unpaid interest as at the date fixed for redemption at any time after the Issue 
Date if the Issuer determines that as a result of a change in the laws of Australia or a change in 
APRAs prudential standards (including following any announcement of a prospective change or 
amendment which has been or will be introduced) all, some or a percentage of all or some 
Subordinated Notes are not or will not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the CBA Group under 
APRAs prudential standards (as amended from time to time), other than as a result of a change of 
treatment expected by the Issuer as at the Issue Date. 
It is not possible to predict whether or not any change in the laws of Australia or a change in APRAs 
prudential standards, or any of the other events referred to above, will occur and so lead to the 
circumstances in which the Issuer is able to elect to redeem Subordinated Notes, and if so whether or 
not the Issuer will elect to exercise such option to redeem Subordinated Notes. There can be no 
assurances that, in the event of any such early redemption, holders of Subordinated Notes will be able 
to reinvest the proceeds at a rate that is equal to the return on Subordinated Notes. 
The Issuers right to redeem Subordinated Notes is subject to prior written approval from APRA. 
Approval is at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given. 
Holders of Subordinated Notes do not have a right to request that their Subordinated Notes be 
Exchanged or redeemed early 
Holders of Subordinated Notes will not have a right to request that their Subordinated Notes be 
Exchanged or redeemed early for any reason. To realise their investment, holders of Subordinated 
Notes can sell their Subordinated Notes at the prevailing market price. However, depending on market 
conditions at the time, Subordinated Notes may be trading at a market price below the Outstanding 
Principal Amount and/or the market for Subordinated Notes may not be liquid. 
There is no restriction on the amount or type of further securities or indebtedness which the Issuer may 
incur 
The Issuer has the right in its absolute discretion to issue additional Senior Ranking Obligations or 
Equal Ranking Securities which may rank ahead of or equally with Subordinated Notes, whether or not 
secured. Any issue of other securities may affect the ability of a holder of Subordinated Notes to 
recover interest or the Outstanding Principal Amount due to a holder of Subordinated Notes in a 
winding up. 
The Conditions do not contain any covenants preventing the Issuer from raising more debt or issuing 
other securities, requiring the Issuer to refrain from certain business changes, or requiring the Issuer to 
operate within certain ratio limits. 
It is difficult to anticipate the effect such debt or other issues of securities may have on the market price 
or liquidity of Subordinated Notes. 
Risks specific to Exempt Notes denominated in Renminbi 
Set out below is a description of the principal risks which may be relevant to an investor in Exempt 
Notes denominated in Renminbi ("Renminbi Notes"): 
Renminbi is not completely freely convertible, there are still significant restrictions on the remittance of 
Renminbi into and out of the PRC and the liquidity of investments in Renminbi Notes is subject to such 
restrictions  
Renminbi is not completely freely convertible as of the date of this Information Memorandum. The 
government of the PRC (the "PRC Government") continues to regulate conversion between Renminbi 
and foreign currencies despite significant reduction in the control by the PRC Government in recent 
years over trade transactions involving the import and export of goods and services, as well as other 
frequent routine foreign exchange transactions. These transactions are known as current account items. 
Participating banks in Hong Kong and a number of other jurisdictions have been permitted to engage in 
the settlement of current account trade transactions in Renminbi; however, remittance of Renminbi into 
and out of the PRC for the settlement of capital account items, such as capital contributions, debt 
For personal use only
 
43 
financing and securities investment, is generally only permitted upon obtaining specific approvals from, 
or completing specific registrations or filings with, the relevant authorities on a case-by-case basis and 
is subject to a strict monitoring system. Regulations in the PRC on the remittance of Renminbi into and 
out of the PRC for settlement of capital account items are (as of the date of this Information 
Memorandum) being developed.  
Although Renminbi was added to the Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies, in addition to the 
U.S. dollar, euro, Yen and Sterling, created by the International Monetary Fund as an international 
reserve asset in 2016 and policies further improving accessibility to Renminbi to settle cross-border 
transactions in foreign currencies were implemented by The Peoples Bank of China (the PBoC) in 
2018, there is no assurance that the PRC Government will liberalise control over cross-border 
remittance of Renminbi in the future, or that new regulations in the PRC will not be promulgated in the 
future that have the effect of restricting or eliminating the remittance of Renminbi into or outside the 
PRC. In the event that funds cannot be repatriated outside the PRC in Renminbi, this may affect the 
overall availability of Renminbi outside the PRC and the ability of the Issuer to source Renminbi to 
finance its obligations under Renminbi Notes. 
There is only limited availability of Renminbi outside the PRC, which may affect the liquidity of 
Renminbi Notes and the Issuers ability to source Renminbi outside the PRC to service such Renminbi 
Notes 
As a result of the restrictions imposed by the PRC Government on cross-border Renminbi fund flows, 
the availability of Renminbi outside the PRC is limited.  
As of the date of this Information Memorandum, licensed banks in Singapore and Hong Kong may 
offer limited Renminbi-denominated banking services to Singapore residents, Hong Kong residents and 
specified business customers. While the PBoC has entered into agreements on the clearing of Renminbi 
business (the Settlement Agreements) with financial institutions in a number of financial centres and 
cities (the RMB Clearing Banks) including, but not limited to, Hong Kong, and is in the process of 
establishing Renminbi clearing and settlement mechanisms in several other jurisdictions, the size of 
Renminbi denominated financial assets outside the PRC is limited. 
Renminbi business participating banks do not have direct Renminbi liquidity support from the PBoC. 
The relevant RMB Clearing Bank only has access to onshore liquidity support from the PBoC for the 
purpose of settling open positions of participating banks for limited types of transactions. The relevant 
RMB Clearing Bank is not obliged to settle for participating banks any open positions resulting from 
other foreign exchange transactions or conversion services. In such cases, the participating banks will 
need to source Renminbi from outside the PRC to settle such open positions. 
Although it is expected that the offshore Renminbi market will continue to grow in depth and size, its 
growth is subject to many constraints as a result of PRC laws and regulations on foreign exchange. 
There is no assurance that new PRC regulations will not be promulgated or the Settlement Agreements 
will not be terminated or amended so as to have the effect of restricting availability of Renminbi outside 
the PRC. The limited availability of Renminbi outside the PRC may affect the liquidity of investments 
in the Renminbi Notes. To the extent that the Issuer is required to source Renminbi outside the PRC to 
service the Renminbi Notes, there is no assurance that the Issuer will be able to source such Renminbi 
on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
Although the Issuers primary obligation is to make all payments with respect to Renminbi Notes in 
Renminbi, where a Renminbi Currency Event is specified as being applicable in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement, in the event that the Issuer determines, while acting in good faith that one of RMB 
Inconvertibility, RMB Non-Transferability or RMB Illiquidity (each as defined in Condition 7(m)) has 
occurred as a result of which, the Issuer is unable to make any payment in respect of the Renminbi Note 
in Renminbi, the terms of such Renminbi Notes will permit the Issuer to make payment in U.S. dollars 
(or such other currency as may be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) converted using the 
Spot Rate (as defined in Condition 7(m)) for the relevant Determination Date, all as provided in 
Condition 7(m). The value of these Renminbi payments in U.S. dollar terms may vary with the 
prevailing exchange rates in the market. 
For personal use only
 
44 
An investment in Renminbi Notes is subject to exchange rate risks 
The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies fluctuates from time to 
time and is affected by changes in the PRC and international political and economic conditions and by 
many other factors. On 11 December 2015, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (the CFETS), 
a sub-institutional organisation of the PBoC, published the CFETS Renminbi exchange rate index for 
the first time, which weighs the Renminbi based upon 13 currencies, to guide the market in order to 
measure the Renminbi exchange rate. Such change and others that may be implemented, may increase 
the volatility in the value of Renminbi against other currencies. All payments of interest and principal 
with respect to Renminbi Notes will be made in Renminbi unless a RMB Currency Event is specified as 
being applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement, and a RMB Currency Event occurs, in which 
case payment will be made in U.S. dollars converted at the Spot Rate. As a result, the value of these 
Renminbi payments in U.S. dollar or other foreign currency terms may vary with the prevailing 
exchange rates in the marketplace. If the value of the Renminbi depreciates against the U.S. dollar or 
other applicable foreign currencies, then the value of an investors investment in Renminbi Notes in 
terms of the U.S. dollar or other applicable foreign currency will decline. 
An investment in fixed rate Renminbi Notes is subject to interest rate risks 
The PRC Government has gradually liberalised its regulation of interest rates in recent years. Further 
liberalisation may increase interest rate volatility. If a Renminbi Note carries a fixed interest rate, then 
the trading price of such Renminbi Notes will vary with fluctuations in Renminbi interest rates. If an 
investor in Renminbi Notes tries to sell such Renminbi Notes before their maturity then they may 
receive an offer that is less than the amount invested. 
Payments in respect of Renminbi Notes will be made to investors in the manner specified in the 
Conditions 
Investors might be required to provide certification and other information (including Renminbi account 
information) in order to be allowed to receive payments in Renminbi in accordance with the Renminbi 
clearing and settlement system for participating banks in Hong Kong or such other RMB Settlement 
Centre(s) as may be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Except in the limited circumstances 
stipulated in Condition 7(l), all payments to investors in respect of Renminbi Notes will be made solely: 
(i) for so long as the Renminbi Notes are represented by a Global Note held with the common 
depositary, for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (each as defined in the Form of the Notes), 
with a sub-custodian for CMU or any alternative clearing system, by transfer to a Renminbi bank 
account maintained in Hong Kong or such other RMB Settlement Centre(s) in accordance with 
prevailing Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg rules and procedures or those of the CMU or such 
alternative clearing system, or (ii) for so long as such Renminbi Notes are in definitive form, by transfer 
to a Renminbi bank account maintained in Hong Kong or such other RMB Settlement Centre(s) in 
accordance with prevailing rules and regulations. The Issuer cannot be required to make payment by 
any other means (including in any other currency or in bank notes, by cheque or draft or by transfer to a 
bank account in the PRC). 
There might be PRC tax consequences with respect to investment in the Renminbi Notes 
In considering whether to invest in Renminbi Notes, investors should consult their individual tax 
advisers with regard to the application of PRC tax laws, as well as any tax consequences arising under 
the laws of any other tax jurisdictions. The value of a Noteholders investment in Renminbi Notes 
might be materially and adversely affected if the Noteholder is required to pay PRC tax with respect to 
acquiring, holding or disposing of and receiving payments under those Renminbi Notes. 
 
Risks related to Green Bonds, Climate Bonds, Sustainable Bonds or any other equivalent or 
similarly titled Exempt Notes 
The application of the net proceeds of Exempt Notes described as Green Bonds, Climate Bonds, 
Sustainable Bonds or any equivalent or similar title may not meet investor expectations or be 
suitable for an investors investment criteria   
For personal use only
 
45 
In connection with any issue of Exempt Notes, it may be stated in Reasons for the Offer in Part B of 
the applicable Final Terms that the intention of the Issuer is, among other things, to allocate the net 
proceeds of the issuance of the Exempt Notes to the financing of one or more eligible projects or assets 
("Eligible Assets" and each an "Eligible Asset") permitted by any standard developed for the 
certification of certain eligible bonds as Green Bonds, Climate Bonds, Sustainable Bonds or any 
equivalent or similar title. Prospective investors in any such Exempt Notes should have regard to the 
information in Reasons for the Offer regarding the use of the net proceeds of such Exempt Notes and 
must determine for themselves the relevance of such information for the purpose of any investment in 
such Exempt Notes together with any other investigation such investor deems necessary. In particular 
no assurance is given by the Issuer or the Dealers that the use of such proceeds for any Eligible Assets 
will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or requirements as 
regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to 
comply. 
There is currently no clear definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to 
what constitutes, or as to what precise attributes are required for a particular project or asset to be 
considered, a green, climate, sustainable or other equivalently-labelled project or asset and no 
assurance can be given that such a clear definition or consensus will develop over time or that any 
prevailing market consensus will not significantly change. Accordingly, no assurance is or can be given 
to investors that any Eligible Asset or use of the net proceeds of the issuance of any Exempt Notes to 
finance any Eligible Asset will meet any or all investor expectations regarding such green, climate, 
sustainable or other equivalently-labelled objectives or that any adverse environmental and/or other 
impacts will not occur during the implementation of, or as a result of any use of the net proceeds of the 
Exempt Notes to finance, any Eligible Asset. 
No assurance or representation is given as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of 
any report, assessment, opinion or certification of any third party (whether or not solicited by the 
Issuer) which may or may not be made available in connection with the issue of any Exempt Notes with 
any such title or stated intention as to the use of the net proceeds of any such issuance and in particular 
as to the fulfillment of any Eligible Assets of any environmental, sustainability and/or other criteria. No 
assurance can also be given that any such criteria will not be amended, updated, replaced or re-issued 
with the result that any such report, assessment, opinion or certification may be withdrawn. Any such 
report, assessment, opinion or certification is not, nor shall be deemed to be, incorporated in and/or 
form part of this Programme Circular and no responsibility is assumed by the Issuer for any such report, 
assessment, opinion or certification. 
Any such report, assessment, opinion or certification is not, nor should be deemed to be, a 
recommendation by the Issuer, the Dealers or any other person to buy, sell or hold any such Exempt 
Notes. Any such report, assessment, opinion or certification is only current as of the date it was issued. 
Prospective investors must determine for themselves the relevance of any such report, assessment, 
opinion or certification and/or the information contained therein and/or the provider of such report, 
assessment, opinion or certification for the purpose of any investment in such Exempt Notes. Currently, 
the providers of such reports, assessments, opinions and certifications are not subject to any specific 
oversight or regulatory or other regime. 
In the event that any Exempt Notes are listed or admitted to trading on any dedicated green, 
climate, environmental, sustainable or other equivalently-labelled segment of any stock exchange 
or securities market (whether or not regulated), or are included in any dedicated "green", 
"environmental", "sustainable" or other equivalently-labelled index, no representation or assurance is 
given by the Issuer, the Dealers or any other person that such listing or admission satisfies, whether in 
whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or requirements as regards any investment 
criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to comply. Furthermore, 
the criteria for any such listings or admission to trading may vary from one stock exchange or securities 
market to another and also the criteria for inclusion in such index may vary from one index to another. 
No representation or assurance is also given or made by the Issuer, the Dealers or any other person that 
any such listing or admission to trading, or inclusion in any such index, will be obtained in respect of 
any such Exempt Notes or, if obtained, that any such listing or admission to trading will be maintained 
during the life of the Exempt Notes. 
While it is the intention of the Issuer in respect of any Exempt Notes with any such title or stated 
intention as to the use of the net proceeds of any such issuance to apply the net proceeds and obtain and 
publish any relevant reports, assessments, opinions and certifications in, or substantially in, the manner 
described in Reasons for the Offer in Part B of the applicable Final Terms, there can be no assurance 
For personal use only
 
46 
that the Issuer will be able to do this. Any such stated intention as to the use of proceeds or to obtain 
and publish any such reports, assessments, opinions and certifications, will not constitute any form of 
undertaking in respect of the Exempt Notes or otherwise and any failure to apply the net proceeds in the 
manner so described or obtain and publish any such reports, assessments, opinions and certifications 
will not constitute an Event of Default (as defined in Condition 11) under the relevant Exempt Notes or 
any other default or breach by the Issuer of any undertaking or obligation in connection with the 
Exempt Notes or give rise to any other claim of a holder of such Exempt Notes against the Issuer. 
Any report, assessment, opinion or certification in respect of any such Exempt Notes may be withdrawn 
at any time and there can be no assurance that such report, assessment, opinion or certification will not 
be withdrawn. There can further be no assurance that any Eligible Assets will be completed within any 
specified period or at all or with the results or outcome (whether or not related to the environment) as 
originally expected or anticipated by the Issuer. 
The withdrawal of any report, assessment, opinion or certification as described above, or any such 
report, assessment, opinion or certification stating or otherwise indicating that the Issuer is not or may 
not be complying in whole or in part with any matters for which such report, assessment, opinion or 
certification is being provided, and/or any such Exempt Notes no longer being listed or admitted to 
trading on any stock exchange or securities market as described above, may have a material adverse 
effect on the value of any such Exempt Notes and/or result in adverse consequences for certain 
investors with a mandate to invest in securities to be used for a particular purpose.

48 
Form of the Exempt Notes 
Except in the case of Subordinated Notes, which must be in registered form ("Registered Notes"), the 
Exempt Notes of each Series will either be in bearer form ("Bearer Notes"), with or without interest 
coupons attached, or Registered Notes, without interest coupons attached. Exempt Notes will be issued 
outside the United States in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Regulation S under 
the Securities Act ("Regulation S"). 
Bearer Notes 
Each Tranche of Bearer Notes will initially be represented by one or more temporary global Notes in 
bearer form (a "Temporary Bearer Global Note") without Coupons, Receipts or Talons (each as defined 
in "Conditions of the Exempt Notes") which will be deposited on the issue date with either (i) a 
common depositary on behalf of Euroclear Bank SA/NV ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking S.A. 
("Clearstream, Luxembourg") or (ii) a sub-custodian for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (the 
"HKMA") as operator of the Central Moneymarkets Unit Service (the "CMU Service"). 
If an interest payment date for any Bearer Notes occurs whilst such Exempt Notes are represented by a 
Temporary Bearer Global Note, the related interest payment will be made through Euroclear and/or 
Clearstream, Luxembourg or the CMU Service against presentation of the Temporary Bearer Global 
Note only to the extent that certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership (in the form set out in the 
Temporary Bearer Global Note) has been received by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any 
entity appointed in relation to the relevant Exempt Notes as the CMU Lodging and Paying Agent as 
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement (the "CMU Lodging and Paying Agent"). On or after the 
date (the "Exchange Date") which is 40 days after the date on which the Temporary Bearer Global Note 
is issued, provided that certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership has been received, interests in the 
Temporary Bearer Global Note will be exchanged either for (i) interests in a permanent global Note in 
bearer form (a "Permanent Bearer Global Note" and, together with a Temporary Bearer Global Note, a 
"Bearer Global Note") or (ii), at the option of the Issuer, Exempt Notes in definitive bearer form. The 
CMU Service may require that any such exchange for a Permanent Bearer Global Note is made in 
whole and not in part and in such event, no such exchange will be effected until all relevant account 
holders (as set out in a CMU Instrument Position Report (as defined in the rules of the CMU Service 
(the "CMU Rules")) or any other relevant notification supplied to the CMU Lodging and Paying Agent 
by the CMU Service) have so certified. No payments of interest will be made on a Temporary Bearer 
Global Note after the Exchange Date. Payments of principal, premium (if any) or interest (if any) on a 
Permanent Bearer Global Note will be made through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg against 
presentation or surrender, as the case may be, of the permanent global Note without any requirement for 
certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership. In respect of a Bearer Global Note held through the 
CMU Service, any payments of principal, interest (if any) or any other amounts shall be made to the 
person(s) for whose account(s) interests in the relevant Bearer Global Note are credited (as set out in a 
CMU Instrument Position Report or any other relevant notification supplied to the CMU Lodging and 
Paying Agent by the CMU Service) and save in the case of final payment, no presentation of the 
relevant Bearer Global Note shall be required for such purpose. The applicable Pricing Supplement will 
specify whether a Permanent Bearer Global Note will be exchangeable in whole for security-printed 
definitive Bearer Notes upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event. For these purposes, "Exchange 
Event" means that (i) the Issuer has been notified that both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, 
in the case of Exempt Notes held through the CMU Service, the CMU Service have been closed for 
business for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or 
have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have in fact done so and no successor 
clearing system is available; or (ii) the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences 
which would not be suffered were the Exempt Notes represented by the Permanent Bearer Global Note 
to be in definitive form. The Issuer will promptly give notice to Noteholders in accordance with 
Condition 16 if an Exchange Event occurs. In the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event (a) in 
the case of Exempt Notes held by a common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, 
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in 
such Permanent Bearer Global Note) and/or (b) in the case of Exempt Notes held through the CMU 
For personal use only
 
49 
Service, the relevant accountholders therein, may give notice to the Principal Paying Agent requesting 
exchange and, in the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event as described in (ii) above, the Issuer 
may also give notice to the Principal Paying Agent or, as the case may be, the CMU Lodging and 
Paying Agent requesting exchange. Any such exchange shall occur not later than 60 days after the date 
of receipt of the first relevant notice by the Principal Paying Agent or, as the case may be, the CMU 
Lodging and Paying Agent. At present, neither Euroclear nor Clearstream, Luxembourg regard Exempt 
Notes in global form as fungible with Exempt Notes in definitive form. Temporary Bearer Global Notes 
and Permanent Bearer Global Notes and definitive Bearer Notes will be issued by the Principal Paying 
Agent acting on behalf of the Issuer. 
The following legend will appear on all Bearer Notes and Coupons: "Any United States person (as 
defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code) who holds this obligation will be subject to 
limitations under the United States income tax laws including the limitations provided in sections 165(j) 
and 1287(a) of such Code." 
The exchange of a Permanent Bearer Global Note for definitive Bearer Notes upon notice from 
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (acting on the instructions of any holder) or at any time at 
the request of the Issuer should not be expressed to be applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement 
if the Bearer Notes are issued with a minimum Specified Denomination such as 100,000 (or its 
equivalent in another currency) plus one or more higher integral multiples of another smaller amount 
such as 1,000 (or its equivalent in another currency).  Furthermore, such Specified Denomination 
construction is not permitted in relation to any issue of Notes which is to be represented on issue by a 
Temporary Bearer Global Note exchangeable for definitive Bearer Notes. 
Registered Notes 
Registered Notes will initially be represented by a global note in registered form (a "Registered Global 
Note" and, together with a Bearer Global Note, a "Global Note"). Registered Global Notes will be 
deposited with either (i) a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and will be 
registered in the name of its nominee or (ii) a sub-custodian for the HKMA as operator of the CMU 
Service. Persons holding beneficial interests in Registered Global Notes will be entitled or required, as 
the case may be, under the circumstances described below, to receive physical delivery of definitive 
Registered Notes. 
Payments of principal, interest and any other amount in respect of the Registered Global Notes will, in 
the absence of provision to the contrary, be made to the person shown on the Register (as defined in 
Condition 7(b)) as the registered holder of the Registered Global Notes. None of the Issuer, any Paying 
Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to 
or payments or deliveries made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Registered Global 
Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership 
interests. 
Payments of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of the definitive Registered Notes will, in 
the absence of provision to the contrary, be made to the persons shown on the Register on the relevant 
Record Date (as defined in Condition 7(b)) immediately preceding the due date for payment in the 
manner provided in that Condition. 
Interests in a Registered Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge), in whole but not in part, for 
definitive Registered Notes without receipts, interest coupons or talons attached only upon the 
occurrence of an Exchange Event. For these purposes, Exchange Event means that (i) the Issuer has 
been notified that both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or, in the case of Exempt Notes held 
through the CMU Service, the CMU Service have been closed for business for a continuous period of 
14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention 
permanently to cease business or have in fact done so and no successor clearing system is available or 
(ii) the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were 
the Exempt Notes represented by the Registered Global Note to be in definitive form. The Issuer will 
promptly give notice to Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 if an Exchange Event occurs. In 
the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event, (a) in the case of Exempt Notes registered in the 
name of a nominee for a common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, Euroclear

and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any person acting on their behalf (acting on the instructions of any 
holder of an interest in such Registered Global Note) and/or (b) in the case of Exempt Notes held 
through the CMU Service, the relevant accountholders therein, may give notice to the Registrar or, as 
the case may be, the CMU Lodging and Paying Agent requesting exchange. Any such exchange shall 
occur not later than 10 days after the date of receipt of the first relevant notice by the Registrar or, as 
the case may be, the CMU Lodging and Paying Agent. 
Clearing Systems 
Pursuant to the Agency Agreement (as defined under "Conditions of the Exempt Notes"), the Principal 
Paying Agent shall arrange that, where a further Tranche of Exempt Notes is issued which is intended 
to form a single Series with an existing Tranche of Exempt Notes at a point after the Issue Date of the 
further Tranche, the Exempt Notes of such further Tranche shall be assigned a common code, ISIN and, 
where applicable, a FISN, CFI and CMU instrument number which are different from the common 
code, ISIN, FISN, CFI and CMU instrument number (as applicable) assigned to Exempt Notes of any 
other Tranche of the same Series until such time as the Tranches are consolidated and form a single 
Series, which shall not be prior to the expiry of the distribution compliance period (as defined in 
Regulation S under the Securities Act) applicable to the Exempt Notes of such Tranche. 
For so long as any of the Exempt Notes are represented by a Global Note held on behalf of Euroclear 
and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or the CMU Service, each person (other than Euroclear or 
Clearstream, Luxembourg or the CMU Service) who is for the time being shown in the records of 
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg or the CMU Service as the holder of a particular nominal 
amount of such Exempt Notes (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear 
or Clearstream, Luxembourg or the CMU Service as to the nominal amount of such Exempt Notes 
standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case 
of manifest error) shall be treated by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and any Transfer Agent or, as the 
case may be, the CMU Lodging and Paying Agent as the holder of such nominal amount of Exempt 
Notes for all purposes other than with respect to payments on the Exempt Notes for which purpose the 
bearer of the relevant Bearer Global Note or the registered holder of the relevant Registered Global 
Note shall be treated by the Issuer and any Paying Agent or, as the case may be, the CMU Lodging and 
Paying Agent as the holder of such Exempt Notes in accordance with and subject to the terms of the 
relevant Global Note and the terms "Noteholder" and "holder of Exempt Notes" and related expressions 
shall be construed accordingly. Exempt Notes held in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg 
and/or the CMU Service and which are represented by a Global Note will only be transferable, and 
payment in respect of them will only be made, in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time 
being of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg or the CMU Service, as the case may be. 
Notwithstanding the above, if an Exempt Note is held through the CMU Service, any payment that is 
made in respect of such Exempt Note shall be made at the direction of the bearer or the registered 
holder to the person(s) for whose account(s) interests in such Exempt Note are credited as being held 
through the CMU Service in accordance with the CMU Rules at the relevant time as notified to the 
CMU Lodging and Paying Agent by the CMU Service in a relevant CMU Instrument Position Report 
or any other relevant notification by the CMU Service (which notification, in either case, shall be 
conclusive evidence of the records of the CMU Service as to the identity of any accountholder and the 
principal amount of any Exempt Note credited to its account, save in the case of manifest error) and 
such payments shall discharge the obligation of the Issuer in respect of that payment under such 
Exempt Note. 
Any reference herein to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or the CMU Service shall, 
whenever the context so permits, be deemed to include a reference to any additional or alternative 
clearance system agreed between the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent and the relevant Dealer. 
An Exempt Note may be accelerated by the holder thereof in certain circumstances described in 
Condition 11. In such circumstances, where any Exempt Note is still represented by a Global Note and 
the Global Note (or any part thereof) has become due and repayable in accordance with the Conditions 
of such Exempt Notes and payment in full of the amount due has not been made in accordance with the 
provisions of the Global Note then the Global Note will become void at 8.00 p.m. (London time) on

such day. At the same time holders of interests in such Global Note credited to their accounts with 
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or the CMU Service, as the case may be, will become 
entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer on the basis of statements of account provided by 
Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg on and subject to the terms of a deed of covenant (the "Deed of 
Covenant") dated 3 July 2019 and executed by the Issuer.

Form of Pricing Supplement 
Set out below is the form of Pricing Supplement which will be completed for each Tranche of Exempt 
Notes issued under the Programme. 
PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS  The Notes are not intended to be 
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made 
available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the "EEA"). For these purposes, a retail 
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 
4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of 
Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended or superseded), where that customer would not qualify as a 
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as 
defined in the Prospectus Directive (as defined below). Consequently no key information document 
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or 
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared 
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in 
the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. 
[MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE/PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ELIGIBLE 
COUNTERPARTIES ONLY TARGET MARKET  Solely for the purposes of [the/each] 
manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to 
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients 
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible 
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or 
recommending the Notes (a distributor) should take into consideration the manufacturer['s/s'] target 
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own 
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer['s/s'] 
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.]1 
[NOTIFICATION UNDER SECTION 309B(1)(C) OF THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES ACT

Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore (as amended) and the Securities and Futures (Capital Markets Products) 
Regulations 2018 of Singapore (the CMP Regulations 2018), the Issuer has determined the 
classification of the Notes to be capital markets products other than prescribed capital markets products 
(as defined in the CMP Regulations 2018) and Specified Investment Products (as defined in the

implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of 
the Notes. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Relevant Member State 
of the Notes may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any Dealer 
to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus 
pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the 
Issuer nor any Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of Notes in 
circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any Dealer to publish or supplement a 
prospectus for such offer.

For the purpose of calculating the U.S. dollar equivalent of the nominal amount of Notes outstanding 
under the Programme from time to time, (i) Zero Coupon Notes will be included in such nominal 
amount by reference to the net proceeds received by the Issuer for the relevant issue, (ii) Dual 
Currency Notes and Index Linked Notes shall be included in such nominal amount by reference to the 
original nominal amount of the relevant issue and (iii) the U.S. dollar equivalent of Notes denominated 
in another Specified Currency shall be determined as of the date of agreement to issue such Notes (the 
"Agreement Date") on the basis of the Exchange Rate on such date. As used in this paragraph, the

interest (if any), all as indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement) are otherwise identical (including 
whether or not they are listed) and shall be deemed to include the temporary and (where applicable) 
permanent global Notes and the definitive Notes of such issues and the expressions "Notes of this

1 
Form, Denomination and Title 
Except in the case of Subordinated Notes, which must be Registered Notes, the Notes of this 
Series are Bearer Notes or Registered Notes as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement 
and in each case are in the currency (the "Specified Currency") and the denominations (the 
"Specified Denomination(s)") specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Definitive Notes 
of this Series (if issued) will be serially numbered and Bearer Notes may not be exchanged for 
Registered Notes and vice versa. This Note is an Unsubordinated Note or a Subordinated Note 
as indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement. This Note is a Fixed Rate Note, a Fixed 
Reset Note, a Floating Rate Note, a Zero Coupon Note, an Index Linked Interest Note, a Dual 
Currency Interest Note or any appropriate combination thereof depending upon the Interest 
Basis specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and is a Dual Currency Redemption 
Note, an Index Linked Redemption Note, an Instalment Note or a combination of any of the 
foregoing, depending on the Redemption/Payment Basis specified in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement. If this Note is a definitive Bearer Note, it is issued with Coupons for the payment 
of interest ("Coupons") and, if applicable, Talons for further Coupons ("Talons") attached, 
unless it is a Zero Coupon Note in which case references to interest (other than in relation to 
interest due after the Maturity Date) and Coupons or Talons in these Conditions are not 
applicable. If this Note is a definitive Bearer Note redeemable in instalments, it is issued with 
Receipts ("Receipts") for the payment of instalments of principal prior to the final Maturity 
Date attached. Wherever Dual Currency Notes or Index Linked Notes are issued to bear 
interest on a fixed or floating rate basis or on a non-interest-bearing basis, the provisions in 
these Conditions relating to Fixed Rate Notes, Floating Rate Notes and Zero Coupon Notes 
respectively shall, where the context so admits, apply to such Dual Currency Notes or Index 
Linked Notes. In the case of Dual Currency Notes, references to the Specified Currency in 
relation to any payment or calculation of a payment are to the currency in which that payment 
is required to be made. This Note is also an Index Linked Note where payment in respect of 
principal (each an "Index Linked Redemption Note") and/or interest (each an "Index Linked 
For personal use only
 
74 
Interest Note") is linked to an Index and/or a Formula, and the appropriate provisions of these 
Conditions will apply accordingly. References in these Conditions, except in this paragraph, 
Condition 7 and Condition 10, to Coupons or Couponholders shall be deemed to include 
references to Talons or Talonholders and Receipts or Receiptholders. 
Subject as set out below, title to the definitive Bearer Notes and the Coupons will pass by 
delivery and title to the definitive Registered Notes will pass upon the registration of transfers 
in accordance with the provisions of the Agency Agreement. The holder of each Coupon, 
whether or not such Coupon is attached to a Bearer Note, in his capacity as such, shall be 
subject to, and bound by, all the provisions contained in the relevant Note. Subject as set out 
below, the Issuer, any Paying Agent and any Transfer Agent may (to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable laws) deem and treat the bearer of any Bearer Note or Coupon and the 
registered holder of any Registered Note as the absolute owner thereof (whether or not such 
Note or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or writing 
thereon or notice of any previous loss or theft thereof) for all purposes but, in the case of any 
global Note, without prejudice to the provisions set out below. 
For so long as any Notes are represented by a global Note held on behalf of Euroclear Bank 
S.A./N.V. ("Euroclear") and/or Clearstream Banking S.A. ("Clearstream, Luxembourg"), each 
person who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, 
Luxembourg as the holder of a particular nominal amount of such Notes (in which regard any 
certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the 
nominal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive and 
binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) shall be treated by the Issuer and 
any Paying Agent as the holder of such nominal amount of Notes for all purposes other than 
with respect to payments on the Notes for which purpose the bearer of the relevant global 
Bearer Note or the registered holder of the relevant global Registered Note shall be treated by 
the Issuer and any Paying Agent as the holder of such Notes in accordance with and subject to 
the terms of the relevant global Note and the terms "Noteholder" and "holder of Notes" and 
related expressions shall be construed accordingly. 
Any reference herein to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg shall, except in the 
preceding paragraph and in Condition 16, wherever the context so permits, be deemed to 
include a reference to any additional or alternative clearance system specified in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement or as may otherwise be approved by the Issuer and the Principal Paying 
Agent. 
Notes which are represented by a global Note held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, 
Luxembourg will only be transferable in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time 
being of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be. 
2 
Transfer 
(a) 
Transfers of beneficial interests in global Registered Notes will be effected by Euroclear or 
Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, and, in turn, by other participants and, if 
appropriate, indirect participants in such clearing systems acting on behalf of transferors and 
transferees of such interests. A beneficial interest in a global Registered Note will, subject to 
compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory restrictions, be transferable for definitive 
Registered Notes or for a beneficial interest in another global Registered Note only in the 
authorised denominations set out in the applicable Pricing Supplement and only in accordance 
with the rules and operating procedures for the time being of Euroclear or Clearstream, 
Luxembourg, as the case may be, and in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in 
the Agency Agreement. 
(b) 
A definitive Registered Note may be transferred in whole or in part (in the nominal amount of 
the lowest Specified Denomination or any integral multiple thereof) by the deposit by the 
transferor of the definitive Registered Note for registration of the transfer at the specified 
office of a Transfer Agent with the form of transfer endorsed on the definitive Registered Note 
duly completed and executed by or on behalf of the transferor and upon the relevant Transfer 
For personal use only
 
75 
Agent (after due and careful enquiry) being satisfied with the documents of title and the 
identity of the person making the request and subject to such reasonable regulations as the 
Issuer and the Registrar may prescribe. Subject as provided above, the relevant Transfer Agent 
will, within fourteen days of the request (or such longer period as may be required to comply 
with any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations), deliver at its specified office to the 
transferee or (at the risk of the transferee) send by mail to such address as the transferee may 
request a new definitive Registered Note of a like aggregate nominal amount to the definitive 
Registered Note (or the relevant part of the definitive Registered Note) transferred. In the case 
of the transfer of part only of a definitive Registered Note, a new definitive Registered Note in 
respect of the balance of the definitive Registered Note not transferred will be so delivered or 
(at the risk of the transferor) sent to the transferor. 
(c) 
In the event of a partial redemption of Notes under Condition 6(d), the Issuer shall not be 
required to: 
(i) 
register the transfer of any definitive Registered Note, or part of a definitive 
Registered Note, called for partial redemption; or 
(ii) 
exchange any definitive Bearer Note called for partial redemption. 
(d) 
Noteholders will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of effecting any registration of 
transfer as provided above, except for any costs or expenses of delivery other than at the 
specified office of a Transfer Agent or by regular mail and except that the Issuer may require 
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp duty, tax or other governmental charge that 
may be imposed in relation to the registration. 
(e) 
The names of the initial Registrar and other initial Transfer Agents and their initial specified 
offices in respect of this Series of Notes are set out at the end of these Conditions. The Issuer 
reserves the right at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of the Registrar or any other 
Transfer Agent and to appoint another Registrar or additional or other Transfer Agents. Notice 
of any termination or appointment and of any changes in specified offices will be given to the 
holders of the Notes of this Series promptly by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16. 
3 
Status of the Notes and Subordination 
(a) 
Status of the Unsubordinated Notes 
If the Notes of this Series are Unsubordinated Notes, the Notes of this Series and the relative 
Coupons (if any) are direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the 
Issuer and will rank equally among themselves and equally with the Issuers other present and 
future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations (except for certain debts that are required to 
be preferred by applicable law). 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. 
The applicable laws include (but are not limited to) sections 13A and 16 of the Banking Act 
1959 of the Commonwealth of Australia (the "Banking Act") and section 86 of the Reserve 
Bank Act 1959 of the Commonwealth of Australia (the "Reserve Bank Act"). These provisions 
provide that in the event that the Issuer becomes unable to meet its obligations or suspends 
payment, its assets in Australia are to be available to meet its liabilities to, among others, the 
Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Reserve Bank of Australia and holders of 
protected accounts held in Australia, in priority to all other liabilities, including the Notes. 
The Notes of this Series are not protected accounts or deposit liabilities of the Issuer for the 
purposes of the Banking Act. 
(b) 
Status and Subordination of the Subordinated Notes 
(1) 
If the Notes of this Series are Subordinated Notes, the Notes of this Series and the relative 
Coupons (if any) are direct and subordinated obligations of the Issuer. 
(2) 
Claims in respect of the Notes of this Series shall rank in a winding up of the Issuer: 
For personal use only
 
76 
(A) 
after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims preferred 
by applicable laws; 
(B) 
equally among themselves and with claims in respect of Equal Ranking Securities; 
and  
(C) 
ahead of all claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims referred 
to in sections 563AA and 563A of the Corporations Act.  
The applicable laws referred to above include (but are not limited to) sections 13A and 16 of 
the Banking Act and section 86 of the Reserve Bank Act. These provisions provide that, in the 
event that the Issuer becomes unable to meet its obligations or suspends payment, its assets in 
Australia are to be available to meet its liabilities to, among others, the Australian Prudential 
Regulation Authority ("APRA"), the Reserve Bank of Australia and holders of protected 
accounts held in Australia, in priority to all other liabilities, including the Notes of this Series. 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. The Notes of 
this Series are not protected accounts or deposit liabilities of the Issuer for the purposes of the 
Banking Act. 
(3) 
In a winding up of the Issuer, payments on each Note of this Series are subject to: 
(A) 
all holders of Senior Ranking Obligations being paid in full before any payment is 
made to Noteholders; and 
(B) 
Noteholders and holders of Equal Ranking Securities being paid on a pro-rata basis.  
(4) 
Each Noteholder irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that: 
(A) 
this Condition 3(b) is a debt subordination for the purposes of section 563C of the 
Corporations Act; 
(B) 
the debt subordination is not affected by any act or omission of the Issuer, or of any 
holder of Senior Ranking Obligations, which might otherwise affect Noteholders at 
law or in equity; 
(C) 
a Noteholder must not exercise its voting rights as an unsecured creditor in the 
winding up or administration of the Issuer in respect of the Notes of this Series to 
defeat the subordination in this Condition 3(b); and 
(D) 
a Noteholder must pay or deliver to the liquidator any amount or asset received on 
account of its claim in the winding up in excess of its entitlement under this 
Condition 3(b). 
(5) 
For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Condition 21(c), if a Non-Viability Trigger Event 
has occurred, the Noteholders will rank in a winding up of the Issuer as holders of the number 
of Ordinary Shares to which they became entitled under Condition 21(a). 
(6) 
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Issuer, any Noteholder or any 
person claiming through any of them has any right of set-off in respect of any amounts owed 
by one person to the other person. 
(7) 
For the purposes of these Conditions, a winding up will not occur solely by reason of (i) an 
application to wind up being made or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, administrator or 
official with similar powers under section 13A(1) of the Banking Act. 
4 
[This Condition is no longer applicable] 
5 
Interest 
(a) 
Interest on Fixed Rate Notes 
(1) 
Each Fixed Rate Note bears interest from and including the Interest Commencement Date at 
the rate(s) per annum equal to the Rate(s) of Interest specified in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement.  
For personal use only
 
77 
Interest will accrue in respect of each Fixed Interest Period. In these Conditions "Fixed Interest 
Period" means the period from (and including) an Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the 
Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first) Interest Payment Date). 
Interest will be payable in arrear on the Interest Payment Date(s) in each year up to (and 
including) the Maturity Date. 
Fixed Interest Periods shall be adjusted ("Adjusted Fixed Rate Notes") or unadjusted 
("Unadjusted Fixed Rate Notes") as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. In the case 
of Adjusted Fixed Rate Notes, a Business Day Convention shall also be specified in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement and (where applicable) Interest Payment Dates shall be 
postponed or brought forward, as the case may be, in accordance with Condition 5(d)(ii). 
In the case of Unadjusted Fixed Rate Notes, if the Notes are in definitive form and if Fixed 
Coupon Amount is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the amount of interest 
payable on each Interest Payment Date in respect of the Fixed Interest Period ending on (but 
excluding) such date will amount to the Fixed Coupon Amount or the Broken Amount (if any) 
so specified. 
Interest will be paid subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Condition 7 (unless 
otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement). Interest will cease to accrue on each 
Fixed Rate Note (or, in the case of the redemption of part only of a Fixed Rate Note, that part 
only of such Note) on the due date for redemption thereof unless, upon due presentation 
thereof, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused, in which event interest will 
continue to accrue (as well after as before any judgment) until, but excluding, whichever is the 
earlier of (A) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Fixed Rate Note up to that day 
are received by or on behalf of the holder of such Fixed Rate Note and (B) the day which is 
seven days after the date on which the Principal Paying Agent has notified the holder in 
accordance with Condition 16 that it has received all sums due in respect thereof up to that 
date. 
The Fixed Coupon Amount will not be applicable in the case of Subordinated Notes. 
(2) 
Except in the case of Unadjusted Fixed Rate Notes in definitive form where an applicable 
Fixed Coupon Amount or Broken Amount, is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, 
the Principal Paying Agent will calculate the amount of interest (the "Interest Amount") 
payable in respect of any period by applying the Rate of Interest to: 
(A) 
in the case of Fixed Rate Notes which are represented by a (i) Global Note or (ii) 
Registered Notes in definitive form, the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of 
(A) the Notes represented by such Global Note or (B) such Registered Notes, unless 
in each case Calculation to be on a Calculation Amount Basis is specified as being 
applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement in which case the Rate of Interest 
shall be applied to the Calculation Amount; or 
(B) 
in the case of Fixed Rate Notes which are Bearer Notes in definitive form (other than 
Subordinated Notes where the Outstanding Principal Amount of such Notes is not a 
multiple of the Calculation Amount), the Calculation Amount; or 
(C) 
in the case of Fixed Rate Notes which are Bearer Notes in definitive form which are 
Subordinated Notes and where the Outstanding Principal Amount of such Notes is not 
a multiple of the Calculation Amount (as calculated as of the applicable date), the 
aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of such Notes; 
and, in each case, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction.  
The resultant figure (including after application of any Fixed Coupon Amount or Broken 
Amount, as applicable, to the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of Fixed Rate Notes, 
which are Registered Notes in definitive form or the Calculation Amount in the case of Fixed 
Rate Notes which are Bearer Notes in definitive form) shall be rounded to the nearest sub-unit 
For personal use only
 
78 
of the relevant Specified Currency, half of any such sub-unit being rounded upwards or 
otherwise in accordance with applicable market convention. 
Where the Specified Denomination or, in the case of Subordinated Notes, the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of:  
(i) 
a Fixed Rate Note which is a Bearer Note in definitive form; or  
(ii) 
a Global Note or Registered Note in definitive form where Calculation to be on a 
Calculation Amount Basis is specified as being applicable in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement, 
is a multiple of the Calculation Amount (as calculated, in the case of Subordinated Notes, as of 
the applicable date), the amount of interest payable in respect of such Fixed Rate Note or such 
Global Note or Registered Note shall be the product of the amount (determined in the manner 
provided above) for the Calculation Amount and the amount by which the Calculation Amount 
is multiplied to reach the Specified Denomination or such Outstanding Principal Amount, 
without any further rounding. 
The calculation of each Interest Amount by the Principal Paying Agent shall (in the absence of 
manifest error) be final and binding upon all parties. 
In this Condition 5(a), "Day Count Fraction" has the meaning given to it in Condition 5(d). 
In these Conditions: 
"Outstanding Principal Amount" has the meaning given in Condition 22(m); and 
"sub-unit" means, with respect to any currency other than euro, the lowest amount of such 
currency that is available as legal tender in the country of such currency and, with respect to 
euro, means one cent. 
(b) 
Interest on Fixed Reset Notes 
Each Fixed Reset Note bears interest: 
(A) 
from (and including) the Interest Commencement Date to (but excluding) the Reset 
Date at the rate per annum equal to the Initial Interest Rate; and 
(B) 
from (and including) the Reset Date to (but excluding) the Maturity Date (the "Reset 
Period") at the rate per annum equal to the aggregate of the Reset Reference Rate and 
the Reset Margin for the Reset Period, 
 (in each case rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded up 
to 0.00001) (each a "Rate of Interest") payable, in each case, in arrear on the Interest Payment 
Date(s) in each year up to and including the Maturity Date. 
For the purposes of any determination by the Principal Paying Agent of the Rate of Interest for 
a Reset Period in accordance with this Condition 5(b), the relevant provisions of Condition 
5(c) shall apply, as applicable, as if the Fixed Reset Notes were Floating Rate Notes. The Rate 
of Interest for each Reset Period shall otherwise be determined by the Principal Paying Agent 
on the relevant Reset Determination Date in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 
5(b).  Other than in respect of determining the Rate of Interest for a Reset Period, the relevant 
provisions of Condition 5(a) shall apply to Fixed Reset Notes, as applicable, as if the Fixed 
Reset Notes were Fixed Rate Notes. 
In these Conditions: 
"Relevant Screen Page" means the display page on the relevant service as specified in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement or such other page as may replace it on that information 
service, or on such other equivalent information service as determined by the Principal Paying 
Agent, for the purpose of displaying the relevant swap rates for swap transactions in the 
Specified Currency with an equivalent maturity to the Reset Period; 
For personal use only
 
79 
"Reset Determination Date" means the second Business Day immediately preceding the 
relevant Reset Date unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; and 
"Reset Reference Rate" means, in relation to a Reset Date and the Reset Period commencing 
on that Reset Date, the form of rate for the Reset Date as indicated in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement, expressed as a percentage, which rate in the specified form appears on the 
Relevant Screen Page as of approximately the Specified Time in the Specified Financial 
Centre on the Reset Determination Date. If such rate does not so appear on the Relevant 
Screen Page, the Reset Reference Rate for the Reset Date will be the Fallback Reset Reference 
Rate for the Reset Period. 
(c) 
Interest on Floating Rate Notes and Index Linked Interest Notes 
The provisions of this Condition 5(c) relating to Index Linked Interest Notes only apply to 
Unsubordinated Notes. 
(1) 
Interest Payment Dates 
Each Floating Rate Note and Index Linked Interest Note bears interest from (and including) 
the Interest Commencement Date and such interest will be payable in arrear on either: 
(A) 
the Specified Interest Payment Date(s) in each year specified in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement; or 
(B) 
if no Specified Interest Payment Date(s) is/are specified in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement, each date (each such date, together with each Specified Interest Payment 
Date, an "Interest Payment Date") which falls the number of months or other period 
specified as the Specified Period in the applicable Pricing Supplement after the 
preceding Interest Payment Date or, in the case of the first Interest Payment Date, 
after the Interest Commencement Date.  
Such interest will be payable in respect of each period from and including an Interest Payment 
Date (or the Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first) Interest 
Payment Date or the relevant payment date if the Notes become payable on a date other than 
an Interest Payment Date (each such period, a "Floating Interest Period" and, together with a 
Fixed Interest Period and a Dual Currency Interest Period (as defined below), each an "Interest 
Period"). 
(2) 
Interest Payments and Accrual 
Interest will be paid subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Condition 7 (unless 
otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement). Interest will cease to accrue on each 
Floating Rate Note or Index Linked Interest Note (or, in the case of the redemption of part 
only of a Floating Rate Note or Index Linked Interest Note, that part only of such Note) on the 
due date for redemption thereof unless, upon due presentation thereof, payment of principal is 
improperly withheld or refused, in which event interest will continue to accrue (as well after as 
before any judgement) until, but excluding, whichever is the earlier of (A) the day on which all 
sums due in respect of such Floating Rate Note or Index Linked Interest Note up to that day 
are received by or on behalf of the holder of such Floating Rate Note or Index Linked Interest 
Note and (B) the day which is seven days after the date on which the Principal Paying Agent 
has notified the holder in accordance with Condition 16 that it has received all sums due in 
respect thereof up to that date. 
(3) 
Rate of Interest and Interest Amount 
The Rate of Interest payable from time to time in respect of each Floating Rate Note and the 
Rate of Interest and/or the Interest Amount payable from time to time in respect of each Index 
Linked Interest Note will be determined in the manner specified in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement. 
(4) 
ISDA Determination for Floating Rate Notes 
For personal use only
 
80 
Where ISDA Determination is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as the manner in 
which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will 
be the relevant ISDA Rate plus or minus (as indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement) 
the Margin (if any). For the purposes of this Condition 5(c)(4), "ISDA Rate" for an Interest 
Period means a rate equal to the Floating Rate that would be determined by the Principal 
Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, under an interest rate swap transaction if 
the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, were acting as the 
Calculation Agent (as defined in the ISDA Definitions (as defined below)) for that swap 
transaction under the terms of an agreement incorporating the 2006 ISDA Definitions, as 
published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. and as amended and 
updated as at the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Notes, (the "ISDA Definitions") and 
under which: 
(A) 
the Floating Rate Option is as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; 
(B) 
the Designated Maturity is a period specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement; 
and 
(C) 
the relevant Reset Date is either (i) if the applicable Floating Rate Option is based on 
the London inter-bank offered rate ("LIBOR") for a currency or on the Euro-zone 
inter-bank offered rate ("EURIBOR") for calculations of payments in euro, the first 
day of that Interest Period or (ii) in any other case, as specified in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement. 
For the purposes of this Condition 5(c)(4), "Floating Rate", "Floating Rate Option", 
"Designated Maturity" and "Reset Date" have the meanings given to those terms in the ISDA 
Definitions. 
When this Condition 5(c)(4) applies, in respect of each relevant Floating Interest Period: 
(i) 
the Rate of Interest for such Floating Interest Period will be the rate of interest 
determined by the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, in 
accordance with this Condition 5(c)(4); and 
(ii) 
the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, will be deemed to 
have discharged its obligations under Condition 5(c)(8) in respect of the 
determination of the Rate of Interest if it has determined the Rate of Interest in 
respect of such Floating Interest Period in the manner provided in this Condition 
5(c)(4). 
(5) 
Screen Rate Determination for Floating Rate Notes not referencing Compounded Daily 
SONIA 
Where "Screen Rate Determination" is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as the 
manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined and the Reference Rate is specified in 
the applicable Pricing Supplement as being "LIBOR" or "EURIBOR", the Rate of Interest for 
a Floating Interest Period will, subject as provided below, be either: 
(A) 
the offered quotation; or 
(B) 
the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 
being rounded upwards) of the offered quotations, 
(expressed as a percentage rate per annum) for the Reference Rate (being either LIBOR or 
EURIBOR, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) which appears or appear, as the 
case may be, on the Relevant Screen Page (or such replacement page on that service which 
displays the information) as at 11.00 a.m. (London time, in the case of LIBOR, or Brussels 
time, in the case of EURIBOR) (the Specified Time) on the Interest Determination Date in 
question plus or minus (as indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement) the Margin (if any), 
all as determined by the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable. If five 
or more such offered quotations are available on the Relevant Screen Page, the highest (or, if 
For personal use only
 
81 
there is more than one such highest quotation, one only of such quotations) and the lowest (or, 
if there is more than one such lowest quotation, one only of such quotations) shall be 
disregarded by the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, for the 
purpose of determining the arithmetic mean (rounded as provided above) of such offered 
quotations. 
In the event that the Relevant Screen Page is not available or if, in the case of (A) above, no 
such offered quotation appears or, in the case of (B) above, fewer than three such offered 
quotations appear, in each case as at the Specified Time, the Principal Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent, as applicable, with the assistance of the Issuer if required, shall request 
each of the Reference Banks (as defined below) to provide the Principal Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent, as applicable, with its offered quotation (expressed as a percentage rate per 
annum) for the Reference Rate at approximately the Specified Time on the Interest 
Determination Date in question. If two or more of the Reference Banks provide the Principal 
Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, with offered quotations, the Rate of 
Interest for the Interest Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth 
decimal place with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of the offered quotations plus or minus 
(as appropriate) the Margin (if any), all as determined by the Principal Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent, as applicable. 
If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides the 
Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, with an offered quotation as 
provided in the preceding paragraph, the Rate of Interest for the relevant Interest Period shall 
be the Reserve Interest Rate.  The Reserve Interest Rate shall be the rate per annum which 
the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, determines to be either (i) 
the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being 
rounded upwards) of the rates, as communicated to (and at the request of) the Principal Paying 
Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, by the Reference Banks or any two or more of 
them, at which such banks offered, at approximately the Specified Time on the relevant 
Interest Determination Date, deposits in the Specified Currency for a period equal to that 
which would have been used for the Reference Rate by leading banks in the London inter-bank 
market (if the Reference Rate is LIBOR) or the Euro-zone inter-bank market (if the Reference 
Rate is EURIBOR) plus or minus (as appropriate) the Margin (if any) or, if fewer than two of 
the Reference Banks provide the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as 
applicable, with offered rates, the offered rate for deposits in the Specified Currency for a 
period equal to that which would have been used for the Reference Rate, or the arithmetic 
mean (rounded as provided above) of the offered rates for deposits in the Specified Currency 
for a period equal to that which would have been used for the Reference Rate, at which, at 
approximately the Specified Time on the relevant Interest Determination Date, any one or 
more banks (which bank or banks is or are in the opinion of the Issuer suitable for the purpose) 
informs the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, it is quoting to 
leading banks in the London inter-bank market (if the Reference Rate is LIBOR) or the Euro-
zone inter-bank market (if the Reference Rate is EURIBOR) plus or minus (as appropriate) the 
Margin (if any), or (ii) in the event that the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, 
as applicable, can determine no such arithmetic mean, the Rate of Interest shall be determined 
as at the last preceding Interest Determination Date (though substituting, where a different 
Margin is to be applied to the relevant Interest Period from that which applied to the last 
preceding Interest Period, the Margin relating to the relevant Interest Period in place of the 
Margin relating to that last preceding Interest Period). 
In this Condition 5(b)(5) the expression Reference Banks means, in the case of a 
determination of LIBOR, the principal London office of four major banks in the London inter-
bank market and, in the case of a determination of EURIBOR, the principal Euro-zone office 
of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, in each case as selected by the 
Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, who may consult the Issuer.

In the case of Notes where "Screen Rate Determination" is specified in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined and the Reference 
Rate is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as being other than "LIBOR", 
"EURIBOR" or "Compounded Daily SONIA", the Agency Agreement contains provisions for 
determining the Rate of Interest in the event that the Relevant Screen Page is not available or 
if, in the case of (A) above, no such offered quotation appears or, in the case of (B) above, 
fewer than three such offered quotations appear, in each case as at the time specified in the 
preceding paragraph. Subject as otherwise provided in the applicable Pricing Supplement, such 
provisions will apply to each such Floating Rate Note where Screen Rate Determination is 
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to 
be determined. 
(5A) 
Screen Rate Determination for Floating Rate Notes referencing Compounded Daily SONIA 
(i) 
Where "Screen Rate Determination" is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement 
as the manner in which the Rate of Interest is to be determined and the Reference 
Rate is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as being "Compounded Daily 
SONIA", the Rate of Interest for a Floating Interest Period will, subject as provided 
below, be Compounded Daily SONIA with respect to such Floating Interest Period 
plus or minus the Margin (if any) as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. 
Compounded Daily SONIA means, with respect to a Floating Interest Period, the 
rate of return of a daily compound interest investment during the Observation Period 
corresponding to such Floating Interest Period (with the SONIA reference rate as 
reference rate for the calculation of interest) as calculated by the Principal Paying 
Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, on the relevant Interest Determination 
Date in accordance with the following formula (and the resulting percentage will be 
rounded if necessary to the nearest fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded 
upwards):

where: 
 d is the number of calendar days in the relevant Floating Interest Period; 
 do is the number of London Banking Days in the relevant Floating Interest Period; 
 i is a series of whole numbers from one to do, each representing the relevant 
London Banking Day in chronological order from, and including, the first London 
Banking Day in the relevant Floating Interest Period; 
London Banking Day or LBD means any day on which commercial banks are 
open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign currency 
deposits) in London; 
ni, for any London Banking Day "i", means the number of calendar days from (and 
including) such London Banking Day "i" up to (but excluding) the following London 
Banking Day; 
Observation Look-Back Period is the period of London Banking Days specified in 
the applicable Pricing Supplement; 
Observation Period means the period from (and including) the date falling p 
London Banking Days prior to the first day of the relevant Floating Interest Period to 
For personal use only
 
83 
(but excluding) the date falling p London Banking Days prior to the Interest 
Payment Date for such Floating Interest Period, or such other date on which the 
relevant payment of interest falls due;  
p is the number of London Banking Days included in the Observation Look-Back 
Period; 
the SONIA reference rate, in respect of any London Banking Day, is a reference 
rate equal to the daily Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) rate for such 
London Banking Day as provided by the administrator of SONIA to authorised 
distributors and as then published on the Relevant Screen Page (or, if the Relevant 
Screen Page is unavailable, as otherwise published by such authorised distributors) on 
the London Banking Day immediately following such London Banking Day; and 
SONIAi-pLBD means the SONIA reference rate for the London Banking Day (being a 
London Banking Day falling in the relevant Observation Period) falling p London 
Banking Days prior to the relevant London Banking Day "i". 
(ii) 
If, in respect of any London Banking Day in the relevant Observation Period, the 
applicable SONIA reference rate is not made available on the Relevant Screen Page 
or has not otherwise been published by the relevant authorised distributors, then 
(unless the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, has been 
notified of any Successor Rate or Alternative Rate (and any related Adjustment 
Spread and/or Benchmark Amendments) pursuant to Condition 5(e) below, if 
applicable) the SONIA reference rate in respect of such London Banking Day shall 
be: (i) the Bank of Englands Bank Rate (the Bank Rate) prevailing at 5.00 p.m. 
(or, if earlier, close of business) on such London Banking Day; plus (ii) the mean of 
the spread of the SONIA reference rate to the Bank Rate over the previous five 
London Banking Days on which a SONIA reference rate has been published, 
excluding the highest spread (or, if there is more than one highest spread, one only of 
those highest spreads) and the lowest spread (or, if there is more than one lowest 
spread, one only of those lowest spreads). 
(iii) 
In the event that the Rate of Interest cannot be determined in accordance with the 
foregoing provisions, the Rate of Interest shall be: 
(A) 
that determined as at the last preceding Interest Determination Date (though 
substituting, where a different Margin, Maximum Rate of Interest and/or 
Minimum Rate of Interest is to be applied to the relevant Floating Interest 
Period from that which applied to the last preceding Floating Interest 
Period, the Margin, Maximum Rate of Interest and/or Minimum Rate of 
Interest (as the case may be) relating to the relevant Floating Interest 
Period, in place of the Margin, Maximum Rate of Interest and/or Minimum 
Rate of Interest (as applicable) relating to that last preceding Floating 
Interest Period); or 
(B) 
if there is no such preceding Interest Determination Date, the initial Rate of 
Interest which would have been applicable to such Series of Notes for the 
first scheduled Floating Interest Period had the Notes been in issue for a 
period equal in duration to the first scheduled Floating Interest Period but 
ending on (and excluding) the Interest Commencement Date (and applying 
the Margin and, if applicable, any Maximum Rate of Interest and/or 
Minimum Rate of Interest, applicable to the first scheduled Floating Interest 
Period). 
(iv) 
If this Series of Notes becomes due and payable in accordance with Condition 11, the 
final Rate of Interest shall be calculated for the Floating Interest Period from (and 
including) the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Interest 
For personal use only
 
84 
Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the date on which the Notes become so due 
and payable, and such Rate of Interest shall continue to apply to the Notes for so long 
as interest continues to accrue thereon as provided in Condition 5(b)(2). 
(6) 
Minimum and/or Maximum Rate of Interest 
This Condition 5(c)(6) only applies to Unsubordinated Notes. 
If the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies a minimum Rate of Interest for any Floating 
Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of any such Floating 
Interest Period determined in accordance with the above provisions is less than such minimum 
Rate of Interest, the Rate of Interest for such Floating Interest Period shall be such minimum 
Rate of Interest. If the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies a maximum Rate of Interest for 
any Floating Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of any such 
Floating Interest Period determined in accordance with the above provisions is greater than 
such maximum Rate of Interest, the Rate of Interest for such Floating Interest Period shall be 
the maximum Rate of Interest. 
Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the minimum Rate of Interest 
shall be deemed to be zero.

Business Day, Interest Determination Date and Relevant Screen Page 
(i) 
In this Condition, "Business Day" has the meaning given to it in Condition 5(d). 
(ii) 
In this Condition, "Interest Determination Date" has the meaning set out in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement. 
(iii) 
In this Condition, "Relevant Screen Page" has the meaning set out in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement. 
(8) 
Determination of Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amount 
The Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, will, as soon as 
practicable after each time at which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, determine the Rate 
of Interest and/or calculate the Interest Amount payable on the Floating Rate Notes or Index 
Linked Notes for the relevant Floating Interest Period as soon as practicable after calculating 
the same. 
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Interest Amount payable 
on the Floating Rate Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes for the relevant Floating Interest 
Period will be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest to: 
(A) 
in the case of Floating Rate Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes which are 
represented by a Global Note, the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Notes represented by such Global Note unless Calculation to be on a Calculation 
Amount Basis is specified as being applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement 
in which case the Rate of Interest shall be applied to the Calculation Amount;  
(B) 
in the case of Floating Rate Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes in definitive form 
(other than Subordinated Notes where the Outstanding Principal Amount of such 
Notes is not a multiple of the Calculation Amount), the Calculation Amount; or 
(C) 
in the case of Floating Rate Notes in definitive form which are Subordinated Notes 
and where the Outstanding Principal Amount of such Notes is not a multiple of the 
Calculation Amount (as calculated as of the applicable date), the aggregate 
Outstanding Principal Amount of such Notes; 
and, in each case, multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction, and rounding 
the resultant figure to the nearest sub-unit of the relevant Specified Currency, half of any such 
sub-unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with applicable market 
convention. Where the Specified Denomination or, in the case of Subordinated Notes, the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of:  
For personal use only
 
85 
(i) 
a Floating Rate Note or an Index Linked Interest Note in definitive form; or  
(ii) 
a Global Note where Calculation to be on a Calculation Amount Basis is specified 
as being applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement, 
is a multiple of the Calculation Amount (as calculated, in the case of Subordinated Notes, as of 
the applicable date), the Interest Amount payable in respect of such Floating Rate Note, such 
Index Linked Interest Note or such Global Note shall be the product of the amount 
(determined in the manner provided above) for the Calculation Amount and the amount by 
which the Calculation Amount is multiplied to reach the Specified Denomination or such 
Outstanding Principal Amount, without any further rounding. 
The determination of the Rate of Interest and calculation of each Interest Amount by the 
Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, shall (in the absence of 
manifest error) be final and binding upon all parties. 
(9) 
Notification of Rate of Interest and Interest Amount 
The Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, will cause the Rate of 
Interest and the Interest Amount for each Floating Interest Period and the relevant Interest 
Payment Date to be notified, other than where the Reference Rate is specified in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement as being Compounded Daily SONIA, to the Issuer and, in the case of 
Floating Rate Notes or Index Linked Interest Notes which are listed on a stock exchange, that 
stock exchange as soon as possible but in any event not later than the second Business Day 
after their determination and will cause notice of such information to be given to the holders of 
the Notes of this Series in accordance with Condition 16 not later than the fourth Business Day 
after their determination and, in the case of Floating Rate Notes referencing Compounded 
Daily SONIA, in the case of notice to each of the Issuer, any stock exchange and in 
accordance with Condition 16 as provided above, the Principal Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent, as applicable, will cause such notice to be given as soon as possible after 
the determination of the relevant Rate of Interest and Interest Amount, and no later than the 
second London Banking Day (as defined in Condition 5(c)(5A) above) after their 
determination. Each Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date so notified may subsequently 
be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way of adjustment) without 
notification as aforesaid in the event of an extension or shortening of the Floating Interest 
Period. Any such amendment will be promptly notified to any stock exchange on which the 
Notes affected thereby are for the time being listed. 
(10) 
Notifications, etc. to be final 
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and decisions 
given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions of these Conditions by 
the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent will (in the absence of default, bad faith 
or manifest error by them or any of their directors, officers, employees or agents) be binding 
on the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Paying Agents and all 
holders of the Notes of this Series and Coupons relating thereto and (in the absence of any 
default, bad faith or manifest error as referred to above) no liability to the Issuer or the holders 
of the Notes of this Series and Coupons relating thereto shall attach to the Principal Paying 
Agent or the Calculation Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by them of 
their powers, duties and discretions under this Condition. 
(11) 
Linear Interpolation 
Where Linear Interpolation is specified as applicable in respect of a Floating Interest Period in 
the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Rate of Interest for such Floating Interest Period shall 
be calculated by the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, by straight 
line linear interpolation by reference to two rates based on the relevant Reference Rate (where 
Screen Rate Determination is specified as applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement) or 
the relevant Floating Rate Option (where ISDA Determination is specified as applicable in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement), one of which shall be determined as if the Designated 
For personal use only
 
86 
Maturity were the period of time for which rates are available next shorter than the length of 
the relevant Floating Interest Period and the other of which shall be determined as if the 
Designated Maturity were the period of time for which rates are available next longer than the 
length of the relevant Floating Interest Period provided however that if there is no rate 
available for a period of time next shorter or, as the case may be, next longer, then the 
Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, shall determine such rate at 
such time and by reference to such sources as it determines appropriate.  
Designated Maturity means, in relation to Screen Rate Determination, the period of time 
designated in the Reference Rate.

"M1" is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the Interest 
Period falls; "M2" is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately 
following the last day of the Interest Period falls; 
"D1" is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Interest Period, unless (i) that day 
is the last day of February or (ii) such number would be 31, in which case D1 will be 30; and 
"D2" is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last day included 
in the Interest Period, unless (i) that day is the last day of February but not the Maturity Date 
or (ii) such number would be 31 and D2 will be 30. 
(ii) 
Business Day Convention 
If a Business Day Convention is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and (x) if there 
is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month in which an Interest Payment Date 
should occur or (y) if any Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day which is not a 
Business Day, then if the Business Day Convention specified is: 
(1) 
in the case where a Specified Period is specified in accordance with Condition 5(c)(1)(B) 
above, the Floating Rate Convention, such Interest Payment Date (A) in the case of (x) above, 
shall be the last day that is a Business Day in the relevant month and the provisions of (b) 
below shall apply mutatis mutandis or (B) in the case of (y) above, shall be postponed to the 
next day which is a Business Day unless it would thereby fall into the next calendar month, in 
which event (a) such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the immediately 
preceding Business Day and (b) each subsequent Interest Payment Date (or other date) shall be 
the last Business Day in the month which falls in the Specified Period after the preceding 
applicable Interest Payment Date occurred; or 
(2) 
the Following Business Day Convention, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the 
next day which is a Business Day; or 
(3) 
the Modified Following Business Day Convention, such Interest Payment Date shall be 
postponed to the next day which is a Business Day unless it would thereby fall into the next 
calendar month, in which event such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward to the 
immediately preceding Business Day; or 
(4) 
the Preceding Business Day Convention, such Interest Payment Date shall be brought forward 
to the immediately preceding Business Day. 
In these Conditions: 
"Business Day" means (unless otherwise stated in the applicable Pricing Supplement): 
(A) 
a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and 
are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign 
currency deposits) in London and, if any Additional Business Centre(s) (other than 
For personal use only
 
89 
TARGET2) is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, in such Additional 
Business Centre(s);  
(B) 
if TARGET2 is specified as an Additional Business Centre in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement, a day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross 
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System (TARGET2) is open; and 
(C) 
either (1) in relation to any sum payable in a Specified Currency other than euro, a 
day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which commercial banks and foreign 
exchange markets settle payments in the principal financial centre of the country of 
the relevant Specified Currency or (2) in relation to any sum payable in euro, a day on 
which TARGET2 is open. 
(e) 
Zero Coupon Notes 
This Condition 5(e) only applies to Unsubordinated Notes. 
Where a Zero Coupon Note becomes due and repayable prior to the Maturity Date and is not 
paid when due, the amount due and repayable shall be the Amortised Face Amount of such 
Note as determined in accordance with Condition 6(g). As from the Maturity Date any overdue 
principal of such Note shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Accrual Yield. Such 
interest shall continue to accrue (as well after as before any judgment) until whichever is the 
earlier of (A) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received 
by or on behalf of the holder of such Note and (B) the day which is seven days after the date 
on which the Principal Paying Agent has notified the holder in accordance with Condition 16 
that it has received all sums due in respect thereof up to that date. Unless otherwise specified 
in the applicable Pricing Supplement, such interest will be calculated as provided for the 
relevant calculation to be made in respect of the applicable Day Count Fraction in Condition 
6(g). 
(f) 
Benchmark Discontinuation 
Notwithstanding the provisions in Conditions 5(b) and 5(c) above, if the Issuer, acting in good 
faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, determines that a Benchmark Event has 
occurred in relation to an Original Reference Rate when any Rate of Interest (or any 
component part thereof) remains to be determined by reference to that Original Reference 
Rate, then the following provisions of this Condition 5(f) shall apply. 
(i) 
Successor Rate or Alternative Rate 
If there is a Successor Rate, then the Issuer shall promptly notify the Principal Paying 
Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, and, in accordance with Condition 16, 
the Noteholders of such Successor Rate and that Successor Rate shall (subject to 
adjustment as provided in Condition 5(f)(ii)) subsequently be used by the Principal 
Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, in place of the Original 
Reference Rate to determine the relevant Rate(s) of Interest (or the relevant 
component part(s) thereof) for all relevant future payments of interest on the Notes 
(subject to the further operation of this Condition 5(f)). 
If there is no Successor Rate but the Issuer, acting in good faith, in a commercially 
reasonable manner and by reference to such sources as it deems appropriate, which 
may include consultation with an Independent Adviser, determines that there is an 
Alternative Rate, then the Issuer shall promptly notify the Principal Paying Agent or 
the Calculation Agent, as applicable, and, in accordance with Condition 16, the 
Noteholders of such Alternative Rate and that Alternative Rate shall (subject to 
adjustment as provided in Condition 5(f)(ii)) subsequently be used in place of the 
Original Reference Rate to determine the relevant Rate(s) of Interest (or the relevant 
For personal use only
 
90 
component part(s) thereof) for all relevant future payments of interest on the Notes 
(subject to the further operation of this Condition 5(f)). 
(ii) 
Adjustment Spread 
If, in the case of a Successor Rate, an Adjustment Spread is formally recommended, 
or formally provided as an option for parties to adopt, in relation to the replacement 
of the Original Reference Rate with the Successor Rate by any Relevant Nominating 
Body, then the Issuer shall promptly notify the Principal Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent, as applicable, and, in accordance with Condition 16, the 
Noteholders of such Adjustment Spread and the Principal Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent, as applicable, shall apply such Adjustment Spread to the 
Successor Rate for each subsequent determination of a relevant Rate of Interest (or a 
component part thereof) by reference to such Successor Rate. 
If, in the case of a Successor Rate where no such Adjustment Spread is formally 
recommended or provided as an option by any Relevant Nominating Body, or in the 
case of an Alternative Rate, the Issuer, acting in good faith, in a commercially 
reasonable manner and by reference to such sources as it deems appropriate, which 
may include consultation with an Independent Adviser, determines that there is an 
Adjustment Spread in customary market usage in the international debt capital 
markets for transactions which reference the Original Reference Rate, where such rate 
has been replaced by the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be), 
then the Issuer shall promptly notify the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation 
Agent, as applicable, and, in accordance with Condition 16, the Noteholders of such 
Adjustment Spread and the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as 
applicable, shall apply such Adjustment Spread to the Successor Rate or the 
Alternative Rate (as the case may be) for each subsequent determination of a relevant 
Rate of Interest (or a component part thereof) by reference to such Successor Rate or 
Alternative Rate (as applicable).  
If no such recommendation or option has been made (or made available) by any 
Relevant Nominating Body, or the Issuer so determines that there is no such 
Adjustment Spread in customary market usage in the international debt capital 
markets and the Issuer further determines, acting in good faith, in a commercially 
reasonable manner and following consultation with an Independent Adviser, that an 
Adjustment Spread is required to be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative 
Rate (as the case may be), then the Adjustment Spread shall be: 
(1) 
the Adjustment Spread determined by the Issuer, acting in good faith, in a 
commercially reasonable manner and following consultation with an 
Independent Adviser, as being the Adjustment Spread recognised or 
acknowledged as being the industry standard for over-the-counter derivative 
transactions which reference the Original Reference Rate, where such rate 
has been replaced by the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case 
may be); or  
(2) 
if there is no such industry standard recognised or acknowledged, such 
Adjustment Spread as the Issuer, acting in good faith, in a commercially 
reasonable manner and following consultation with an Independent Adviser, 
determines to be appropriate, having regard to the objective, so far as is 
reasonably practicable in the circumstances, of reducing or eliminating any 
economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Noteholders as a result 
of the replacement of the Original Reference Rate with the Successor Rate or 
the Alternative Rate (as the case may be).  
For personal use only
 
91 
Following any such determination of the Adjustment Spread, the Issuer shall 
promptly notify the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, 
and, in accordance with Condition 16, the Noteholders of such Adjustment Spread 
and the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, shall apply 
such Adjustment Spread to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case 
may be) for each subsequent determination of a relevant Rate of Interest (or a 
component part thereof) by reference to such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate (as 
applicable).  
(iii) 
Benchmark Amendments 
If any Successor Rate, Alternative Rate or Adjustment Spread is determined in 
accordance with this Condition 5(f) and the Issuer, acting in good faith, in a 
commercially reasonable manner and by reference to such sources as it deems 
appropriate, which may include consultation with an Independent Adviser, 
determines in its discretion (A) that amendments to these Conditions and/or the 
Agency Agreement are necessary to ensure the proper operation of such Successor 
Rate, Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread (such amendments, the "Benchmark 
Amendments") and (B) the terms of the Benchmark Amendments, then the Issuer and 
the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, shall agree 
without any requirement for the consent or approval of Noteholders to the necessary 
modifications to these Conditions and/or the Agency Agreement to give effect to such 
Benchmark Amendments with effect from the date specified in such notice, subject to 
the Issuer having to give notice thereof to the Noteholders in accordance with 
Condition 16 and any Benchmark Amendments not increasing the obligations or 
duties, or decreasing the rights or protections, of the Principal Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent, as applicable, in these Conditions and/or the Agency Agreement 
unless agreed between the Issuer and the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation 
Agent, as applicable. 
In connection with any such modifications in accordance with this Condition 5(f)(iii), 
if and for so long as the Notes are admitted to trading and listed on the official list of 
a stock exchange, the Issuer shall comply with the rules of that stock exchange. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 5(f), no Successor Rate, 
Alternative Rate or Adjustment Spread will be adopted, nor will any other 
amendment to the terms and conditions of any Series of Notes be made to effect the 
Benchmark Amendments, if and to the extent that (A) in the determination of the 
Issuer, the same could reasonably be expected to prejudice the treatment of any 
relevant Series of Subordinated Notes as Tier 2 Capital or (B) APRA has not given its 
prior written approval. Approval is at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be 
given. 
Any Benchmark Amendments determined under this Condition 5(f)(iii) shall be 
notified promptly by the Issuer to the Principal Paying Agent or the Calculation 
Agent, as applicable, and, in accordance with Condition 16, the Noteholders. Such 
notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the effective date of such Benchmark 
Amendments. 
(iv) 
Independent Adviser 
In the event the Issuer is to consult with an Independent Adviser in connection with 
any determination to be made by the Issuer pursuant to this Condition 5(f), the Issuer 
shall use its reasonable endeavours to appoint an Independent Adviser, as soon as 
reasonably practicable, for the purposes of any such consultation. 
For personal use only
 
92 
An Independent Adviser appointed pursuant to this Condition 5(f) shall act in good 
faith and in a commercially reasonable manner and (in the absence of fraud or wilful 
default) shall have no liability whatsoever to the Issuer or the Noteholders for any 
determination made by it or for any advice given to the Issuer in connection with any 
determination made by the Issuer pursuant to this Condition 5(f) or otherwise in 
connection with the Notes. 
If the Issuer consults with an Independent Adviser as to whether there is an 
Alternative Rate and/or any Adjustment Spread is required to be applied and/or in 
relation to the quantum of, or any formula or methodology for determining such 
Adjustment Spread and/or whether any Benchmark Amendments are necessary 
and/or in relation to the terms of any such Benchmark Amendments, a written 
determination of that Independent Adviser in respect thereof shall be conclusive and 
binding on all parties, save in the case of manifest error, and (in the absence of fraud 
or wilful default) the Issuer shall have no liability whatsoever to the Noteholders in 
respect of anything done, or omitted to be done, in relation to that matter in 
accordance with any such written determination. 
No Independent Adviser appointed in connection with the Notes (acting in such 
capacity), shall have any relationship of agency or trust with the Noteholders. 
(v) 
Survival of Original Reference Rate Provisions 
Without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer under this Condition 5(f), the 
Original Reference Rate and the fallback provisions provided for in Conditions 5(b), 
5(c), the Agency Agreement and the applicable Pricing Supplement, as the case may 
be, will continue to apply unless and until the Issuer has determined the Successor 
Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be), and any Adjustment Spread and 
Benchmark Amendments, in accordance with the relevant provisions of this 
Condition 5(f). 
(vi) 
Definitions 
In this Condition 5(f): 
Adjustment Spread means either a spread, or the formula or methodology for 
calculating a spread and the spread resulting from such calculation, which spread may 
in either case be positive or negative and is to be applied to the Successor Rate or the 
Alternative Rate (as the case may be) where the Original Reference Rate is replaced 
with the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be). 
Alternative Rate means an alternative benchmark or screen rate which the Issuer 
determines in accordance with this Condition 5(f) is used in place of the Original 
Reference Rate in customary market usage in the international debt capital markets 
for the purposes of determining rates of interest (or the relevant component part 
thereof) for a commensurate interest period and in the same Specified Currency as the 
Notes. 
Benchmark Event means the earlier to occur of: 
(A) 
the Original Reference Rate ceasing to be published for at least five Business 
Days or ceasing to exist or be administered; 
(B) 
the later of (i) the making of a public statement by the administrator of the 
Original Reference Rate that it will, by a specified date, cease publishing the 
Original Reference Rate permanently or indefinitely (in circumstances where 
For personal use only
 
93 
no successor administrator has been appointed that will continue publication 
of the Original Reference Rate) and (ii) the date falling six months prior to 
such specified date; 
(C) 
the making of a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the 
Original Reference Rate that the Original Reference Rate has been 
permanently or indefinitely discontinued, is prohibited from being used or is 
no longer representative, or that its use is subject to restrictions or adverse 
consequences or, where such discontinuation, prohibition, restrictions or 
adverse consequences are to apply from a specified date after the making of 
any public statement to such effect, the later of the date of the making of 
such public statement and the date falling six months prior to such specified 
date; and 
(D) 
it has or will prior to the next Interest Determination Date or Reset 
Determination Date, as applicable, become unlawful for the Calculation 
Agent, any Paying Agent or the Issuer to determine any Rate of Interest 
and/or calculate any Interest Amount using the Original Reference Rate 
(including, without limitation, under Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011, if 
applicable). 
Independent Adviser" means an independent financial institution of international 
repute or other independent adviser of recognised standing with appropriate expertise 
appointed by the Issuer at its own expense; 
Original Reference Rate means the benchmark or screen rate (as applicable) 
originally specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement for the purposes of 
determining the relevant Rate of Interest (or any component part thereof) in respect of 
the Notes (provided that if, following one or more Benchmark Events, such originally 
specified Reference Rate (or any Successor Rate or Alternative Rate which has 
replaced it) has been replaced by a (or a further) Successor Rate or Alternative Rate 
and a Benchmark Event subsequently occurs in respect of such Successor Rate or 
Alternative Rate, the term Original Reference Rate shall include any such 
Successor Rate or Alternative Rate); 
Relevant Nominating Body means, in respect of a benchmark or screen rate (as 
applicable): 
(A) 
the central bank for the currency to which the benchmark or screen rate (as 
applicable) relates, or any central bank or other supervisory authority which 
is responsible for supervising the administrator of the benchmark or screen 
rate (as applicable); or 
(B) 
any working group or committee sponsored by, chaired or co-chaired by or 
constituted at the request of (i) the central bank for the currency to which the 
benchmark or screen rate (as applicable) relates, (ii) any central bank or other 
supervisory authority which is responsible for supervising the administrator 
of the benchmark or screen rate (as applicable), (iii) a group of the 
aforementioned central banks or other supervisory authorities, or (iv) the 
Financial Stability Board or any part thereof; and 
Successor Rate means a successor to or replacement of the Original Reference Rate 
which is formally recommended by any Relevant Nominating Body. 
(g) 
Dual Currency Interest Notes 
For personal use only
 
94 
This Condition 5(g) only applies to Unsubordinated Notes. 
(1) 
In the case of Dual Currency Interest Notes where the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies 
that Condition 5(g)(2) is not applicable and the rate of interest falls to be determined by 
reference to the Rate of Exchange, the provisions for determining the rate of interest, accrual 
of interest, calculation of interest amounts, determination of interest payment dates and other 
relevant provisions shall be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and payment shall 
be made in accordance with Condition 7. 
(2) 
If the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies that Condition 5(g)(2) is applicable, each Dual 
Currency Interest Note will bear interest from (and including) the Interest Commencement 
Date and such interest will be payable in arrear on the Interest Payment Date(s) in each year up 
to (and including) the Maturity Date. 
Such interest will be payable in respect of each period from and including an Interest Payment 
Date (or the Interest Commencement Date) to (but excluding) the next (or first) Interest 
Payment Date (each such period, a "Dual Currency Interest Period"). 
The Calculation Agent will calculate the Interest Amount payable on Dual Currency Interest 
Notes for the relevant Dual Currency Interest Period by applying the Rate of Interest to: 
(A) 
in the case of Dual Currency Interest Notes which are represented by a Global Note, 
the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes represented by such Global 
Note unless Calculation to be on a Calculation Amount Basis is specified as being 
applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement in which case the Rate of Interest 
shall be applied to the Calculation Amount; or 
(B) 
in the case of Dual Currency Interest Notes in definitive form, the Calculation 
Amount, 
and, in each case rounding the resultant figure to the nearest whole JPY, with half a JPY being 
rounded upwards (with the resultant figure of FX1 or FX0, as applicable, or any equivalent 
calculation in any Rate of Interest formula for the determination of the Rate of Interest 
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to be rounded to the nearest five decimal places 
of one per cent. for the purposes of the calculation of such Interest Amount). Where the 
Specified Denomination of:  
(i) 
a Dual Currency Interest Note in definitive form; or  
(ii) 
a Global Note where Calculation to be on a Calculation Amount Basis is specified 
as being applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement, 
is a multiple of the Calculation Amount, the amount of interest payable in respect of such Dual 
Currency Interest Note or such Global Note shall be the product of the amount (determined in 
the manner provided above) for the Calculation Amount and the amount by which the 
Calculation Amount is multiplied to reach the Specified Denomination, without any further 
rounding. 
If the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies a Minimum Rate of Interest for any Dual 
Currency Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of any such Dual 
Currency Interest Period determined in accordance with the above provisions is less than such 
Minimum Rate of Interest, the Rate of Interest for such Dual Currency Interest Period shall be 
such Minimum Rate of Interest. If the applicable Pricing Supplement specifies a Maximum 
Rate of Interest for any Dual Currency Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of 
Interest in respect of any such Dual Currency Interest Period determined in accordance with 
the above provisions is greater than such Maximum Rate of Interest, the Rate of Interest for 
such Dual Currency Interest Period shall be the Maximum Rate of Interest. 
In this Condition 5(g)(2): 
"Bloomberg Screen Page "BFIX" means the Bloomberg FX Fixings page designated as the 
"BFIX" page or such other page as may replace it on that information service, or on such other 
For personal use only
 
95 
equivalent information service as may be nominated by the person providing or sponsoring 
such information, in all cases for the purpose of displaying the FX Rate in succession thereto; 
"Business Day" has the meaning given to it in Condition 5(d); 
"FX1" means the mid-price of the bid and offered rates for the FX Rate, expressed as a number 
of JPY per Relevant Currency Amount as of 15:00. Tokyo time on the Reference Date which 
appears for the Relevant Currency Pair on Bloomberg Screen Page "BFIX"; 
"JPY" shall mean Japanese yen; and 
"Reference Date" shall be the 10th Business Day immediately preceding each Interest Payment 
Date. 
The Calculation Agent will cause the Interest Amount to be notified to the Principal Paying 
Agent, which will cause such Interest Amount to be further notified as provided in Condition 
5(b)(9). 
In the event that Bloomberg Screen Page "BFIX" (or such successor page) should not be 
available, or the bid and offered rate for the FX Rate should not appear on Bloomberg Screen 
Page "BFIX" (or any successor page), in each case on the relevant Reference Date at or around 
15:00 Tokyo time, then the Calculation Agent shall determine FX1 by requesting each of the 
five leading banks in the relevant currency and foreign exchange markets (the "Reference 
Banks"), as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide a quotation for FX1. 
If four or five such quotations are provided as requested, after disregarding the highest of such 
quotations and the lowest of such quotations (provided that, if two or more such quotations are 
the highest such quotations, then only one of such quotations shall be disregarded, and if two 
or more such quotations are the lowest quotations then only one of such lowest quotations 
shall be disregarded), the applicable rate shall be determined by the Calculation Agent as the 
arithmetic mean (rounded to the nearest five decimal places, 0.000005 being rounded upwards) 
of the remaining such quotations for such rate. 
If only three or fewer such quotations are provided as requested, the applicable rate shall be 
the arithmetic mean of such quotations as determined by the Calculation Agent as described 
above. 
If no such quotations are provided as requested, and the Calculation Agent determines in its 
sole discretion that no suitable replacement Reference Banks who are prepared to quote are 
available, the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to calculate the applicable rate in good faith 
and a commercially reasonable manner. 
(h) 
Subordinated Notes 
For the purposes of this Condition 5 and notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of 
this Condition 5, in the case of Subordinated Notes, no interest accrues on the Notes, or the 
relevant percentage of Notes, required to be Exchanged in the period from (and including) the 
Interest Payment Date that immediately precedes the Non-Viability Trigger Event to the 
Subordinated Note Exchange Date or Write Down Date (as applicable). 
6 
Redemption and Purchase 
(a) 
Final Redemption 
Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled (or, in the case of Subordinated Notes, 
Exchanged or Written Down in full) as provided below, each Note of this Series will be 
redeemed at its Final Redemption Amount in the relevant Specified Currency on the Maturity 
Date (as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement). 
(b) 
Redemption for Tax Reasons 
Subject to Condition 6(g) and, in the case of Subordinated Notes, Condition 6(m), the Notes of 
this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer in whole, but not in part, at any time (in 
For personal use only
 
96 
the case of Notes other than Floating Rate Notes and Dual Currency Notes) or on any Interest 
Payment Date (in the case of Floating Rate Notes and Dual Currency Notes), on giving not 
less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice in accordance with Condition 16 (which notice shall 
be irrevocable), at the Early Redemption Amount provided in, or calculated in accordance 
with, paragraph (g) or (h) (as applicable) below, together with (if provided in such paragraphs) 
interest accrued up to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, if: 
(1) 
in the case of Unsubordinated Notes (i) the Issuer has or will become obliged to pay 
additional amounts as provided or referred to in Condition 9 or (ii) the Issuer becomes 
obliged to pay approved issuer levy at a rate exceeding the rate of the levy being 
charged at the date of issue of the Notes as a result of any change in, or amendment 
to, the laws or regulations of the Commonwealth of Australia or any political 
subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, or any change in 
the application or official interpretation of such laws or regulations (including the 
manner of exercising any official discretion thereunder), which change or amendment 
becomes known generally or to the Issuer on or after the Issue Date (or, in the case of 
a second or subsequent Tranche of Notes of this Series, the Issue Date for the original 
Tranche) (a "Change in Tax Laws"); or 
(2) 
in the case of Subordinated Notes, the Issuer receives an opinion from reputable legal 
counsel or another tax adviser in Australia, experienced in such matters, to the effect 
that there is a material risk that as a result of a Change in Tax Laws (including 
following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment which has been 
or will be introduced) the Issuer would be exposed to a more than de minimis adverse 
tax consequence in relation to the Notes of this Series other than a tax consequence 
the Issuer expected as at the Issue Date, 
provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 60 business days before 
the earliest date (or, in the case of Floating Rate Notes and Dual Currency Notes, the Interest 
Payment occurring immediately before  such earliest date) on which the Issuer would be: 
(a) 
in the case of Unsubordinated Notes, obliged to pay such additional amounts; or 
(b) 
in the case of Subordinated Notes, subject to the adverse tax consequence, 
and, for the purpose only of determining the earliest date on which such notice may be given, 
it shall be deemed that a payment, in respect of which the Issuer would be obliged to pay such 
additional amounts or subject to the adverse tax consequence is due in respect of the Notes of 
this Series on the day on which any such change or amendment becomes effective. 
Holders of Subordinated Notes should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for any 
redemption of the Subordinated Notes. 
(c) 
Redemption for Regulatory Reasons 
This Condition 6(c) applies only to Subordinated Notes. 
Subject to Condition 6(m), the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer 
in whole, but not in part, at any time (in the case of Notes other than Floating Rate Notes) or 
on any Interest Payment Date (in the case of Floating Rate Notes), on giving not less than 30 
nor more than 60 days notice in accordance with Condition 16 (which notice shall be 
irrevocable), at the Early Redemption Amount provided in, or calculated in accordance with, 
paragraph (g) or (h) (as applicable) below, together with (if provided in such paragraphs) 
interest accrued up to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, if the Issuer determines 
that as a result of a change in the laws of Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards 
(including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment which has 
been or will be introduced) all, some or a percentage of all or some of the Notes are not or will 
not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the Group under APRAs prudential standards (as amended 
from time to time), other than as a result of a change of treatment expected by the Issuer as at 
the Issue Date provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 60 
For personal use only
 
97 
business days before the earliest date (or, in the case of Floating Rate Notes, the Interest 
Payment Date occurring immediately before such earliest date) on which all, some or a 
percentage of all or some of the Notes will cease to be treated as Tier 2 Capital. 
Holders of Subordinated Notes should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for any 
redemption of the Subordinated Notes. 
(d) 
Redemption at the Option of the Issuer (Issuer Call) 
If Issuer Call is specified as being applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Issuer 
may (subject to Condition 6(m) in the case of Subordinated Notes) on any Optional 
Redemption Date specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement at its option, on giving not 
less than the period of notice specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement to the holders of 
the Notes of this Series (which notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for 
redemption) in accordance with Condition 16, redeem all or from time to time some only of 
the Notes of this Series then outstanding on the relevant Optional Redemption Date (as 
specified in the notice of redemption) and at the Optional Redemption Amount(s) specified in 
the applicable Pricing Supplement together with (in the case of Fixed Rate Notes) interest 
accrued to, but excluding, the relevant Optional Redemption Date. 
In the event of a redemption of some only of such Notes, such redemption must be for an 
amount being not less than the Minimum Redemption Amount and not more than the 
Maximum Redemption Amount (if any) specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. In the 
case of a partial redemption of Notes, Notes to be redeemed will be selected individually by lot 
(without involving any part only of a Bearer Note) not less than 40 days prior to the date fixed 
for redemption. In the case of a partial redemption where some or all of the Notes are 
represented by a global Note held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, 
such redemption with respect to those Notes will take place in accordance with the procedures 
of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg from time to time. Each notice of redemption 
will specify the date fixed for redemption and, in the case of a partial redemption, the 
aggregate nominal amount, and, where some or all of the Notes are in definitive form, the 
serial numbers, of the Notes to be redeemed and, in each case, the aggregate nominal amount 
of the Notes of this Series which will be outstanding after the partial redemption. In addition, 
in the case of a partial redemption of a Series of Notes which includes Registered Notes, the 
Issuer will publish an additional notice of redemption not less than 80 nor more than 95 days 
before the date fixed for redemption which notice will specify the period during which 
exchanges or transfers of Notes may not be made as provided in Condition 2. 
Holders of Subordinated Notes should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for any 
redemption of the Subordinated Notes. In the case of Subordinated Notes, the first Optional 
Redemption Date will be a date not earlier than the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date. 
(e) 
Redemption at the Option of the Noteholders (Investor Put) 
This Condition 6(e) only applies to Unsubordinated Notes. 
If Investor Put is specified as being applicable in the applicable Pricing Supplement, upon any 
Noteholder giving to the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16 not less than 30 nor more 
than 60 days notice (the "notice period"), the Issuer will, upon the expiry of such notice 
redeem in whole (but not in part) the Notes the subject of the notice on the Optional 
Redemption Date and at the Optional Redemption Amount indicated in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement together with (in the case of Fixed Rate Notes) interest accrued up to, but 
excluding, the Optional Redemption Date. It may be that before an Investor Put can be 
exercised, certain conditions and/or circumstances will need to be satisfied. Where relevant, 
the provisions will be set out in the applicable Pricing Supplement. 
To exercise the right to require redemption of this Note the holder of this Note must, if this 
Note is in definitive form, and held outside Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, deliver, 
at the specified office of any Paying Agent (in the case of Bearer Notes) or the Registrar (in 
the case of Registered Notes) on any business day (as defined in Condition 7(h)) falling within

being current) obtainable from any specified office of any Paying Agent or from the Registrar 
(a "Put Notice") and, in the case of a Put Notice in respect of Bearer Notes, in which the holder 
must specify a bank account outside Australia to which payment is to be made under this 
Condition. If this Note is in definitive form, the Put Notice must be accompanied by this Note 
or evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent concerned that this Note will, following delivery 
of the Put Notice, be held to its order or under its control. 
If this Note is represented by a Global Note or is in definitive form and held through Euroclear 
or Clearstream, Luxembourg, to exercise the right to require redemption of this Note the 
holder of this Note must, within the notice period, give notice to the Principal Paying Agent of 
such exercise in accordance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, 
Luxembourg (which may include notice being given on his instruction by Euroclear or 
Clearstream, Luxembourg or any common depositary for them to the Principal Paying Agent 
by electronic means) in a form acceptable to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg from 
time to time. 
A Put Notice or other notice given by a holder of any Note pursuant to this Condition 6(e), 
once delivered, shall be irrevocable and the Issuer shall redeem all Notes delivered therewith 
on the applicable redemption date. 
(f) 
Pricing Supplement 
The applicable Pricing Supplement indicates that either (1) this Note cannot be redeemed prior 
to its Maturity Date except as provided in paragraph (b) above or (2) that this Note will be 
redeemable at the option of the Issuer and/or the holder of this Note prior to such Maturity 
Date in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and/or (e) above an Optional

This Condition 6(g) only applies to Unsubordinated Notes. 
(1) 
The amount payable in respect of any Zero Coupon Note upon redemption of such Note 
pursuant to paragraph (b), (d) or (e) above or upon it becoming due and repayable as provided 
in Condition 11 shall be an amount (the "Amortised Face Amount") calculated in accordance 
with the formula for the Accrual Method specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement: 
Linear Accrual: Amortised Face Amount = Reference Amount x (1+ Accrual Yield x 
y) 
Compounding Accrual: Amortised Face Amount = Reference Amount x (1+Accrual 
Yield)y 
where:  
"Reference Amount" means: 
(A) 
the product of the Issue Price and: 
(i) 
in the case of a Zero Coupon Note represented by a Global Note 
where the Zero Coupon Notes are being redeemed in full, the 
aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of the Notes represented 
by such Global Note, unless Calculation to be on a Calculation 
Amount Basis is specified as being applicable in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement; or 
(ii) 
in the case of a Zero Coupon Note in definitive form or where some

(ii) 
the Global Note or a Zero Coupon Note represented by a Global 
Note, as applicable, where Calculation to be on a Calculation 
Amount Basis is specified as being applicable in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement or the Reference Amount is otherwise to be 
determined by reference to the Calculation Amount, 
is a multiple of the Calculation Amount, the Reference Amount in respect of 
such Zero Coupon Note or such Global Note shall be the product of the 
amount (determined in the manner provided above) for the Calculation 
Amount and the amount by which the Calculation Amount is multiplied to 
reach the Specified Denomination, without any further rounding. 
"Accrual Yield" means the rate specified as such in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement; and 
"y" is the Day Count Fraction specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement 
which will be either (i) 30/360 (Fixed) or 30/360 unadjusted (in which case 
the numerator will be equal to the number of days (calculated on the basis of 
a 360-day year consisting of 12 months of 30 days each) from (and 
including) the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Notes to (but excluding) 
the date fixed for redemption or (as the case may be) the date upon which 
such Note becomes due and repayable and the denominator will be 360) or 
(ii) Actual/360 (in which case the numerator will be equal to the actual 
number of days from (and including) the Issue Date of the first Tranche of 
the Notes to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption or (as the case 
may be) the date upon which such Note becomes due and repayable and the 
denominator will be 360) or (iii) Actual/365 (Fixed) (in which case the 
numerator will be equal to the actual number of days from (and including) 
the Issue Date of the first Tranche of the Notes to (but excluding) the date 
fixed for redemption or (as the case may be) the date upon which such Note 
becomes due and repayable and the denominator will be 365). 
(2) 
If the amount payable in respect of any Zero Coupon Note upon redemption of such Note 
pursuant to paragraph (b), (d) or (e) above or upon its becoming due and repayable as provided 
in Condition 11 is improperly withheld or refused, the amount due and repayable in respect of 
such Note shall be the amount calculated as provided in Condition 6(g)(1) above as though the 
references therein to the date fixed for the redemption or the date upon which such Note 
becomes due and payable were replaced by references to the date which is the earlier of: 
(a) 
the date on which all amounts due in respect of such Note have been paid; and 
(b) 
the date on which the full amount of the moneys payable in respect of such Note has 
been received by the Agent and notice to that effect has been given to the Noteholders 
in accordance with Condition 16. 
(h)

This Condition 6(i) only applies to Unsubordinated Notes. 
In respect of an Index Linked Redemption Note or a Dual Currency Redemption Note where 
the amount payable in respect of principal upon redemption (the "Final Redemption Amount") 
falls to be determined by reference to one or more Indices and/or Formulae or, as the case may 
be, Rates of Exchange, the Final Redemption Amount shall be determined in accordance with 
such Indices and/or Formulae or, as the case may be, Rates of Exchange in the manner 
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement and each such Index Linked Redemption Note 
or Dual Currency Redemption Note shall, unless previously redeemed or purchased and 
cancelled as provided below, be redeemed at the applicable Final Redemption Amount on the 
Maturity Date. In respect of an Index Linked Redemption Note or a Dual Currency 
Redemption Note where the amount payable on an early redemption (including an early 
redemption pursuant to Condition 11) in respect of principal only or principal and interest (the 
"Early Redemption Amount") falls to be determined in whole or in part by reference to one or 
more Indices and/or Formulae or, as the case may be, Rates of Exchange, the Early 
Redemption Amount shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable Pricing Supplement 
and shall be paid together with, in the case of a Note where the Early Redemption Amount is

purchase Notes of this Series (provided that all unmatured Coupons appertaining to such 
Notes, if in definitive bearer form, are attached thereto or surrendered therewith) in any 
manner and at any price. 
All Notes of this Series together, in the case of definitive Notes in bearer form, with all 
unmatured Coupons appertaining thereto, purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer (other than 
those Notes purchased in the ordinary course of the business of dealing in securities) will be 
cancelled forthwith. 
(k) 
Instalments 
Each Note which is redeemable in instalments will be redeemed in the Instalment Amounts 
and on the Instalment Dates, in the case of all instalments other than the final instalment by (in 
the case of Bearer Notes in definitive form) surrender of the relevant Receipt (which must be 
presented with the Note to which it appertains) or by (in the case of Notes represented by a 
global Note) presentation and endorsement of the global Note, and (in the case of the final 
instalment) by surrender of the relevant Note, all in accordance with Condition 7. 
(l) 
Business days 
Where any period of notice for the purposes of any redemption of the Notes under this 
Condition 6 is expressed as a specified number of business days, the expression "business day" 
shall have the meaning given in Condition 7(h). 
(m) 
APRA approval required to redeem or purchase 
This Condition 6(m) applies only to Subordinated Notes. 
The Issuer may only redeem or purchase Notes under Conditions 6(b), 6(c), 6(d) and 6(j) if: 
(A) 
either: 
(i) 
before or concurrently with the redemption or purchase, the Issuer replaces 
the Notes with a capital instrument which is of the same or better quality (for 
the purposes of APRAs prudential standards as they are applied to the CBA 
For personal use only

regard to the capital position of the CBA Level 1 Group and CBA Level 2 
Group, that the Issuer does not have to replace the Notes; and

APRA has given its prior written approval to the redemption or purchase. Approval is 
at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given.

Payments and Exchange of Talons 
(a) 
Payments in respect of definitive Bearer Notes 
(1) 
Payments of principal and interest (if any) in respect of definitive Bearer Notes (if issued) will 
(subject as provided below) be made against surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, 
presentation and endorsement) of definitive Bearer Notes, Receipts or Coupons (which 
expression, in this Condition and Condition 10, shall not include Receipts or Talons), as the 
case may be, at any specified office of any Paying Agent outside Australia. 
(2) 
In the case of Bearer Notes in definitive form, payments of principal in respect of instalments 
(if any), other than the final instalment, will (subject as provided below) be made against 
surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, presentation and endorsement) of the relevant 
Receipt. Payment of the final instalment will be made against surrender (or, in the case of part 
payment only, presentation and endorsement) of the relevant definitive Bearer Note. Each 
Receipt must be presented for payment of such instalment together with the relevant definitive 
Bearer Note against which the amount will be payable in respect of that instalment. If any 
definitive Bearer Notes are redeemed or become repayable prior to the Maturity Date in 
respect thereof, principal will be payable on surrender of each such Note together with all 
unmatured Receipts appertaining thereto. Unmatured Receipts and Receipts presented without 
the definitive Bearer Notes to which they appertain do not constitute obligations of the Issuer. 
(3) 
All payments of principal and interest with respect to definitive Bearer Notes will be made 
outside Australia and (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) below) the United States. 
Payments in any currency other than euro in respect of definitive Bearer Notes will (subject as 
provided below) be made by transfer to an account (in the case of payment in Yen to a non-
resident of Japan, a non-resident account) in the Specified Currency maintained by the payee 
with a bank in the principal financial centre of the country of the Specified Currency (or, if the 
Specified Currency is Australian dollars or U.S. dollars, in London or another place outside 
Australia and (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) below)) provided that if at any 
time such payments cannot be so made, then payments will be made outside Australia and 
(except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) below) the United States in such other manner 
as the Issuer may determine and notify in accordance with Condition 16. Payments in euro in 
respect of definitive Bearer Notes will be made by transfer to a euro account outside Australia 
and (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) below) the United States (or any other 
account outside Australia and (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) below) the 
United States to which euro may be transferred) specified by the payee. 
(b) 
Payments in respect of Registered Notes 
Payments of principal in respect of Registered Notes (whether or not in global form) will 
(subject as provided in this Condition) be made against presentation and surrender of such 
Registered Notes at the specified office outside Australia of the Registrar by a cheque in the 
Specified Currency drawn on a bank in the principal financial centre of the country of the 
Specified Currency. Payments of interest in respect of Registered Notes will (subject as 
provided in this Condition) be made by a cheque in the Specified Currency drawn on a bank in 
the principal financial centre of the country of the Specified Currency and posted on the 
business day in the city in which the Registrar has its specified office immediately preceding 
the relevant due date to the holder (or to the first named of joint holders) of the Registered 
For personal use only
 
102 
Note appearing on the register of holders of the Registered Notes maintained by the Registrar 
(the "Register") (i) where in global form, at the close of the business day (being for this 
purpose a day on which Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are open for business) before 
the relevant due date, and (ii) where in definitive form, at the close of business on the fifteenth 
day (whether or not such fifteenth day is a business day) before the relevant due date (the 
"Record Date") at his address shown on the register on the Record Date. Upon application of 
the holder to the specified office of the Registrar not less than three business days in the city in 
which the Registrar has its specified office before the due date for any payment in respect of a 
Registered Note, the payment of principal and/or interest may be made (in the case of payment 
of principal against presentation and surrender of the relevant Registered Note as provided 
above) by transfer on the due date to an account in the Specified Currency maintained by the 
payee with a bank in the principal financial centre of the country of the Specified Currency 
subject to the provisions of the following two sentences. If the Specified Currency is 
Australian dollars, payment will be made (in the case of a transfer to a bank account) by 
transfer to an account in London or another place outside Australia and, if the Specified 
Currency is Yen, payment will be made (in the case of payment to a non-resident of Japan) by 
cheque drawn on, or by transfer to a non-resident account. If the Specified Currency is euro, 
payment will be made in euro to a euro account outside Australia (or any other account outside 
Australia to which euro may be credited or transferred, as the case may be), specified by the 
payee. 
(c) 
Payments in respect of global Bearer Notes 
(1) 
Payments of principal and interest (if any) in respect of Notes represented by any global 
Bearer Note will (subject as provided below) be made in the manner specified in the relevant 
global Note against presentation and endorsement or surrender, as the case may be, of such 
global Note at the specified office of any Paying Agent outside Australia. A record of each 
payment made on such global Note, distinguishing between any payment of principal and 
interest, will be made on such global Note by the Paying Agent to which such global Note is 
presented for the purpose of making such payment, and such record shall (save in the case of 
manifest error) be conclusive evidence that the payment in question has been made. 
(2) 
The holder of a global Bearer Note shall be the only person entitled to receive payments in 
respect of Notes represented by such global Note and the Issuer will be discharged by payment 
to, or to the order of, the holder of such global Note in respect of each amount so paid. Each of 
the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a 
particular nominal amount of Notes must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, 
Luxembourg, as the case may be, for his share of each payment so made by the Issuer to, or to 
the order of, the holder of the relevant global Note. Subject to Condition 12, no person other 
than the holder of a global Bearer Note shall have any claim against the Issuer in respect of 
any payments due on that global Note. 
(d) 
Payments of interest in U.S. dollars in respect of Bearer Notes 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments of interest in U.S. dollars in respect of Bearer Notes 
will only be made at the specified office of any Paying Agent in the United States (which 
expression, as used herein, means the United States (including the States and District of 
Columbia and its possessions)) (1) if (A) the Issuer shall have appointed Paying Agents with 
specified offices outside the United States with the reasonable expectation that such Paying 
Agents would be able to make payment at such specified offices outside the United States of 
the full amount of interest on the Bearer Notes in the manner provided above when due, (B) 
payment of the full amount of such interest at all such specified offices outside the United 
States is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions and 
(C) such payment is then permitted under United States law and (2) at the option of the 
relevant holder if such payment is then permitted under United States law without involving, 
in the opinion of the Issuer, adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. 
(e) 
Payments in cash 
For personal use only
 
103 
Without prejudice to any Exchange, nothing in this Condition 7 allows a payment in respect of 
Subordinated Notes other than by way of a cash payment. 
(f) 
Payments subject to applicable laws 
Payments in respect of the Notes will be subject in all cases to (i) any fiscal or other laws and 
regulations applicable thereto in any jurisdiction, but without prejudice to the provisions of 
Condition 9 and (ii) any withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described 
in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") or otherwise 
imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations thereunder or 
any official interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement between the United 
States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or any law 
implementing such an intergovernmental agreement) (collectively referred to as "FATCA"), 
and any such amounts withheld or deducted will be treated as paid for all purposes under the 
Notes, and no additional amounts will be paid on or in respect of the Notes with respect to any 
such withholding or deduction. 
(g) 
Unmatured Receipts, Coupons and Talons 
(1) 
Fixed Rate Notes in definitive bearer form (other than Long Maturity Notes (as defined in 
subparagraph (2)) and Dual Currency Notes and save as provided in Condition 7(f)) should be 
presented for redemption together with all unmatured Coupons (which expression shall include 
Coupons falling to be issued on exchange of Talons which will have matured on or before the 
relevant redemption date) appertaining thereto, failing which, the amounts of any missing 
unmatured Coupons (or, in the case of payment of principal not being made in full, that 
proportion of the aggregate amount of such missing unmatured Coupons that the sum of 
principal so paid bears to the total principal amount due) will be deducted from the sum due 
for payment. Any amount of principal so deducted will be paid in the manner mentioned above 
against surrender of the relative missing Coupons at any time in the period expiring 10 years 
after the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 9) for the payment of such principal, whether 
or not such Coupon would otherwise have become void pursuant to Condition 10 or, if later, 
five years from the due date for payment of such Coupon. Upon any Fixed Rate Note in 
definitive bearer form becoming due and repayable prior to its Maturity Date, all unmatured 
Receipts and Talons (if any) appertaining thereto will become void and no payments in respect 
of any such Receipts and no further Coupons in respect of any such Talons will be made or 
issued, as the case may be. 
(2) 
Upon the due date for redemption of any Floating Rate Note, Long Maturity Note, Dual 
Currency Note or Index Linked Interest Note in definitive bearer form, any unmatured 
Receipts, Coupons or Talons relating to such Note (whether or not attached) shall become void 
and no payment or exchange, as the case may be, shall be made in respect of them. Where any 
such Note is presented for redemption without all unmatured Receipts, Coupons or Talons 
relating to it, redemption shall be made only against the provision of such indemnity as the 
Issuer may require. A Long Maturity Note is a Fixed Rate Note (other than a Fixed Rate Note 
which on issue had a Talon attached) whose nominal amount on issue is less than the 
aggregate interest payable thereon provided that such Note shall cease to be a Long Maturity 
Note on the Fixed Interest Date on which the aggregate amount of interest remaining to be 
paid after that date is less than the nominal amount of such Note. 
(h) 
Payments due on non-business days 
If any date for payment of principal, interest or any other payment in respect of any Bearer 
Note, Receipt or Coupon is not a business day, then the holder thereof shall not be entitled to 
payment at the place of presentation of the amount due until either (A) if the Payment 
Business Day Convention is specified as Following Business Day Convention in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement, the next following business day or (B) if the Payment Business 
Day Convention is specified as Modified Following Business Day Convention in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement, the next day which is a business day unless it would thereby 
fall into the next calendar month, in which event the holder shall be entitled to such payment at 
For personal use only
 
104 
the place of presentation on the immediately preceding business day (in each case, unless 
otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) and shall not be entitled to any 
interest or other sum in respect of any such postponed payment. 
If any date for payment of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of any Registered 
Note is not a business day, then the holder thereof shall not be entitled to payment, in the case 
of principal, at the place of presentation or, in the case of interest or any other amount, by 
transfer to an account specified by the holder until either (A) if Following Business Day 
Convention is specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the next following business day 
or (b) if Modified Following Business Day Convention is specified in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement, the next day which is a business day unless it would thereby fall into the next 
calendar month, in which event the holder shall be entitled to payment at the place of 
presentation or to such account as applicable on the immediately preceding business day (in 
each case, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement) and shall not be 
entitled to any interest or other sum in respect of any such postponed payment. 
This Condition 7(h) does not affect the determination of the Subordinated Exchange Date. 
In this Condition "business day" means, subject as provided in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement: 
(i) 
a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and 
are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign 
currency deposits) in: 
(A) 
in the case of Notes in definitive form only, the relevant place of 
presentation;  
(B) 
any Additional Financial Centre (other than TARGET2) specified in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement;  
(C) 
if TARGET2 is specified as an Additional Financial Centre in the applicable 
Pricing Supplement, a day on which TARGET2 is open, and 
(ii) 
either (1) in relation to any sum payable in a Specified Currency other than euro, a 
day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and 
are open for general business (including dealing in foreign exchange and foreign 
currency deposits) in the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant 
Specified Currency or (2) in relation to any sum payable in euro, a day on which 
TARGET2 is open. 
(i) 
Payment of accrued interest 
If the due date for redemption of any interest bearing Bearer Note in definitive form is not a 
due date for the payment of interest relating thereto, interest accrued in respect of such Note 
from, and including, the last preceding due date for the payment of interest (or, if none, from 
the Interest Commencement Date) will be paid only against surrender (or, in the case of part 
payment, presentation and endorsement) of such Note. 
(j) 
Exchange of Talons 
On and after the Interest Payment Date on which the final Coupon comprised in any Coupon 
sheet matures, the Talon (if any) forming part of such Coupon sheet may be surrendered at the 
specified office of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg (or any other Paying Agent notified by 
the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 for the purposes of this 
paragraph) in exchange for a further Coupon sheet including (if such further Coupon sheet 
does not include Coupons to, and including, the final date for the payment of interest due in 
respect of the Bearer Note in definitive form to which it appertains) a further Talon, subject to 
the provisions of Condition 10. Each Talon shall, for the purposes of these Conditions, be 
deemed to mature on the Interest Payment Date on which the final Coupon comprised in the 
Coupon sheet in which that Talon was included on issue matures.

Initial Paying Agents 
The initial Principal Paying Agent and the other initial Paying Agents in respect of this Series 
of Notes are set out below. If any additional Paying Agents are appointed in connection with 
any Series, the names of such Paying Agents will be specified in Part B of the applicable 
Pricing Supplement. The Issuer may at any time vary or terminate the appointment of any 
Paying Agent and appoint additional or other Paying Agents, provided that it will, so long as 
any of the Notes of this Series is outstanding, maintain: 
(i) 
a Principal Paying Agent,

in a leading financial centre in Europe, and 
(iii) 
so long as any Notes of this Series are admitted to trading on a stock exchange, a 
Paying Agent (which may be the Principal Paying Agent) having a specified office in 
such place as may be required by that stock exchange. 
In addition, the Issuer shall forthwith appoint a Paying Agent having a specified office in New 
York City in the circumstances described in paragraph (d) of this Condition. Notice of any 
variation, termination or change in Paying Agents will be given to the Noteholders promptly 
by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 16. 
(l) 
All payments in respect of the Notes in RMB will be made solely by credit to a RMB account 
maintained by the payee at a bank in Hong Kong or such other financial centre(s) as may be 
specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement as RMB Settlement Centre(s) in accordance 
with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines issued from time to time (including all 
applicable laws and regulations with respect to the settlement of RMB in Hong Kong or any 
relevant RMB Settlement Centre(s)). 
(m) 
RMB Currency Event 
If RMB Currency Event is specified as being applicable in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement and a RMB Currency Event, as determined by the Issuer acting in good faith, 
exists on a date for payment of any amount in respect of any Note, Receipt or Coupon, the 
Issuers obligation to make a payment in RMB under the terms of the Notes may be replaced 
by an obligation to pay such amount in the Relevant Currency converted using the Spot Rate 
for the relevant Rate Calculation Date. 
Upon the occurrence of a RMB Currency Event, the Issuer shall give notice as soon as 
practicable to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 stating the occurrence of the 
RMB Currency Event, giving details thereof and the action proposed to be taken in relation 
thereto. 
For the purpose of this Condition 7(m) and unless stated otherwise in the applicable Pricing

on the Rate Calculation Date, on a deliverable basis by reference to Reuters Screen Page 
TRADCNY3, or if no such rate is available, on a non-deliverable basis by reference to Reuters 
Screen Page TRADNDF. If neither rate is available, the RMB Calculation Agent shall 
determine the rate taking into consideration all available information which the RMB

Structured Note Fallback Provisions 
This Condition 8 only applies to Unsubordinated Notes. 
(a) 
Index Linked Notes 
(1) 
Index Adjustment Events  
If: 
(A) 
on or prior to any date on which the level of a relevant Index is to be calculated, 
including without limitation any Averaging Date or Valuation Date (a "Determination 
Date"), in respect of Index Linked Notes, the relevant Index Sponsor makes or 
announces that it will make a material change in the formula for or the method of 
calculating the Index or in any other way materially modifies the Index (other than a 
modification prescribed in that formula or method to maintain the Index in the event 
of changes in constituent stock and capitalisation and other routine events) (an "Index 
Modification") or permanently cancels the Index and no successor Index exists (an 
"Index Cancellation"); or 
(B) 
on any Determination Date in respect of Index Linked Notes the Index Sponsor fails 
to calculate and announce a relevant Index (an "Index Disruption" and together with 
an Index Modification and an Index Cancellation, an "Index Adjustment Event"), 
For personal use only
 
107 
then the Calculation Agent shall determine if the Index Adjustment Event has a 
material effect on the Index Linked Notes and, if so, shall calculate the level of the 
affected Index for the relevant Determination Date by using, in lieu of a published 
level for the affected Index, the level for that Index as at the relevant time on that 
Determination Date as determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the 
formula for and method of calculating the affected Index last in effect prior to the 
Index Adjustment Event, but using only those securities that constituted the affected 
Index immediately prior to the Index Adjustment Event. 
In the event that the Calculation Agent determines that it cannot or can no longer continue to 
calculate the affected Index, the Calculation Agent may determine that the Index Adjustment 
Event constitutes an Additional Disruption Event. 
(2) 
Successor Index Sponsor or Substitution of Index with Substantially Similar Calculation 
If a relevant Index is (A) not calculated and announced by the Index Sponsor but is calculated 
and announced by a successor sponsor ("Successor Index Sponsor") acceptable to the 
Calculation Agent or (B) replaced by a successor index ("Successor Index") using, in the 
determination of the Calculation Agent, the same or a substantially similar formula for and 
method of calculation as used in the calculation of the affected Index, then (i) the index as 
calculated and announced by the Successor Index Sponsor or (ii) the Successor Index, will be 
deemed to be the relevant Index. 
(3) 
Correction of an Index 
If the level of a relevant Index used or to be used by the Calculation Agent in making any 
determination is subsequently corrected and the correction is published by the Index Sponsor 
or a Successor Index Sponsor prior to the second Index Exchange Business Day preceding the 
due date for the relevant payment on the Notes in respect of which the determination was made 
(the "Cut-off Date"), the Calculation Agent shall recalculate the relevant amount payable using 
the corrected level of the relevant Index. The Calculation Agent shall notify the Issuer of (A) 
that correction and (B) the corrected amount of the relevant payment, as soon as possible after 
their determination and the Issuer will cause that information to be notified to Noteholders in 
accordance with Condition 16 as soon as possible thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, 
corrections published on or after the relevant Cut-off Date shall be disregarded by the 
Calculation Agent. 
(4) 
Consequences of Disrupted Days following a Market Disruption Event affecting an Index or 
Basket of Indices 
If, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, a Valuation Date is a Disrupted Day, then: 
(A) 
in the case of Index Linked Notes referencing an Index, the Valuation Date shall be 
the first succeeding Scheduled Trading Day that is not a Disrupted Day, unless each 
of the eight Scheduled Trading Days immediately following the original date that, but 
for the Disrupted Days, would have been the Valuation Date (the "Scheduled 
Valuation Date") is a Disrupted Day. In that case (i) the eighth Scheduled Trading 
Day shall be deemed to be the Valuation Date, notwithstanding the fact that such day 
is a Disrupted Day, and (ii) the Calculation Agent shall determine the level of the 
Index (the "Index Level") as of the Valuation Time on the eighth Scheduled Trading 
Day in the manner set out in the applicable Pricing Supplement or, if not so set out or 
if not practicable, in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating the 
Index last in effect prior to the occurrence of the first Disrupted Day using the 
relevant Index Exchange traded or quoted price (the "Traded Price") as of the 
Valuation Time on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day of each security included in 
the Index (or, if an event giving rise to a Disrupted Day has occurred in respect of a 
relevant security included in the Index on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day, its 
determination of the Traded Price for the relevant security as of the Valuation Time 
on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day); or 
For personal use only
 
108 
(B) 
in the case of Index Linked Notes referencing a Basket of Indices, the Valuation Date 
for each Index not affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day shall be the 
Scheduled Valuation Date, and the Valuation Date for each Index affected by the 
occurrence of a Disrupted Day (each an "Affected Index") shall be the first 
succeeding Scheduled Trading Day for the Affected Index that is not a Disrupted Day 
relating to the relevant Affected Index, unless each of the eight Scheduled Trading 
Days for the Affected Index immediately following the Scheduled Valuation Date is a 
Disrupted Day relating to the relevant Affected Index. In that case (i) that eighth 
Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed to be the Valuation Date for the relevant 
Affected Index, notwithstanding the fact that such day is a Disrupted Day, and (ii) the 
Calculation Agent shall determine the level of the relevant Affected Index as of the 
Valuation Time on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day in the manner set out in the 
applicable Pricing Supplement or, if not so set out or if not practicable, in accordance 
with the formula for and method of calculating the relevant Affected Index last in 
effect prior to the occurrence of the first Disrupted Day relating to the relevant 
Affected Index using the relevant Traded Price as of the Valuation Time on that 
eighth Scheduled Trading Day of each security included in the relevant Affected 
Index (or if an event giving rise to a Disrupted Day has occurred in respect of a 
relevant security included in the relevant Affected Index on that eighth Scheduled 
Trading Day, its determination of the Traded Price for the relevant security as of the 
Valuation Time on that eighth Scheduled Trading Day). 
In connection with the postponement of any Determination Date the relevant date for payment 
of the amount to be calculated by reference to such Determination Date and the Maturity Date 
may also be postponed by the Issuer or the Calculation Agent to enable the relevant calculation 
to be made and the Issuer will cause notice of any such postponement to be notified to 
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 as soon as possible thereafter. No additional 
amounts shall be payable by the Issuer as a result of any postponement of payment or 
postponement of the Maturity Date in these circumstances. 
(5) 
Additional Disruption Event 
If an Additional Disruption Event occurs, the Issuer may: 
(A) 
(without limiting its ability to subsequently give an Additional Disruption Event 
Notice under paragraph (B) below in the event of any determination by the 
Calculation Agent that no appropriate adjustment can be made under this paragraph 
(A)) request that the Calculation Agent determines whether an appropriate adjustment 
can be made to the Conditions and/or any other provisions relating to the Notes to 
account for the economic effect of the Additional Disruption Event on the Notes and 
to preserve substantially the economic effect to the Noteholders of a holding of the 
Notes. If the Calculation Agent determines that an appropriate adjustment can be 
made, the Issuer shall determine the effective date of the adjustment and take the 
necessary steps to effect the adjustment. The Issuer shall notify the Noteholders of 
any adjustment in accordance with Condition 16 as soon as reasonably practicable 
after the nature and effective date of the adjustment is determined. If the Calculation 
Agent determines that no adjustment that could be made would produce a 
commercially reasonable result and preserve substantially the economic effect to the 
Noteholders of a holding of the Notes it shall notify the Issuer of such determination 
and no adjustment shall be made. None of the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or any 
other party shall be liable to any Noteholder or any other person for any 
determination and/or adjustment made by the Calculation Agent and/or the Issuer 
pursuant to this Condition; or 
(B) 
on giving not less than 5 Business Days irrevocable notice to Noteholders in 
accordance with Condition 16 (such notice an "Additional Disruption Event Notice") 
redeem all of the Notes in whole at their Early Settlement Amount on the date 
For personal use only
 
109 
specified in the Additional Disruption Event Notice (the "Early Settlement Date"). 
Any Additional Disruption Event Notice shall also specify details of the Additional 
Disruption Event concerned and the Early Settlement Amount. 
(6) 
FX Disruption Event 
If FX Disruption Event is specified as applying in the applicable Pricing Supplement, upon the 
occurrence of an FX Disruption Event, the Issuer may take any one or more of the actions 
described below: 
(A) 
make payment of any amount payable by the Issuer pursuant to the Conditions in the 
Payment Currency instead of the Specified Currency, the amount payable in the 
Specified Currency being determined by the Calculation Agent; or 
(B) 
deduct an amount calculated by the Calculation Agent as representing any applicable 
charge or deduction arising in connection with the FX Disruption Event from any 
amount payable by the Issuer pursuant to the Conditions; or 
(C) 
postpone the relevant payment date until, in the determination of the Calculation 
Agent, the FX Disruption Event is no longer subsisting. 
Upon the occurrence of an FX Disruption Event, the Issuer shall give notice as soon as 
practicable to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 16 stating the occurrence of the 
FX Disruption Event and giving details thereof and the action proposed to be taken in relation 
thereto. 
(b) 
Adjustments Generally 
(1) 
Adjustments not Made by a Futures or Options Exchange 
Notwithstanding that an adjustment is required to be made by this Condition in respect of any 
event affecting an Index or its Index Sponsor, the Issuer reserves the right not to make that 
adjustment if, at the time the adjustment is to be made, an option on the relevant Index is 
traded on any Futures or Options Exchange and no adjustment is made by that Futures or 
Options Exchange to the entitlement under that traded option in respect of that event. 
(2) 
Notice of Adjustments 
All determinations made by the Calculation Agent pursuant to this Condition shall be 
conclusive and binding on the Noteholders, the Agents and the Issuer, except in the case of 
manifest error. The Issuer will give, or procure that there is given, notice as soon as practicable 
of any adjustment and of the date from which such adjustment is effective by publication in 
accordance with Condition 16, provided that failure to give, or non-receipt of, such notice will 
not affect the validity or binding nature of the relevant adjustment. 
(c) 
Calculations and Determinations 
(1) 
Manner of making Calculations and Determinations 
All calculations and determinations by the Issuer and the Calculation Agent under this 
Condition shall be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. 
(2) 
Rounding Conventions 
For the purposes of any calculations required pursuant to these Conditions (unless otherwise 
specified) (a) all percentages resulting from such calculations shall be rounded, if necessary, to 
the nearest one hundredth of a percentage point (with 0.005 per cent. being rounded up), (b) all 
figures shall be rounded to two decimal places (with 0.005 being rounded up) and (c) all 
currency amounts that fall due and payable shall be rounded to the nearest unit of such 
currency (with 0.005 being rounded up). For these purposes, "unit" means the lowest amount 
of such currency that is available as legal tender in the country of such currency. 
(3) 
Disclaimer of Liability 
For personal use only
 
110 
The Calculation Agent shall have no responsibility or liability to any person for errors or 
omissions in any calculations or determinations made, or actions taken, pursuant to this 
Condition 8 and Condition 5(f) above and all such calculations and determinations shall (save 
in the case of manifest error) be final and binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the 
Noteholders. 
(d) 
Definitions 
"Averaging Date" means, in respect of a Reference Date each date specified as an Averaging 
Date in the applicable Pricing Supplement or, if any such date is not a Scheduled Trading Day 
for all the Indices, the immediately following Scheduled Trading Day for all the Indices 
unless, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, any such day is a Disrupted Day for any of the 
Indices. If any such day is a Disrupted Day, then: 
(A) 
if "Omission" is specified as applying in the applicable Pricing Supplement, then such 
date will be deemed not to be an Averaging Date for the purposes of determining the 
relevant level or amount provided that, if through the operation of this provision no 
Averaging Date would occur in respect of such Reference Date, then the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(4) above will apply for purposes of determining the level, of the 
relevant Index or Indices on the final Averaging Date with respect to that Reference 
Date as if such final Averaging Date were a Valuation Date that was a Disrupted Day; 
or 
(B) 
if "Postponement" is specified as applying in the applicable Pricing Supplement, then 
the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) above will apply for the purposes of determining 
the level of the relevant Index or Indices on that Averaging Date as if such Averaging 
Date were a Valuation Date that was a Disrupted Day irrespective of whether, 
pursuant to such determination, that deferred Averaging Date would fall on a day that 
already is or is deemed to be an Averaging Date; or 
(C) 
if "Modified Postponement" is specified as applying in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement then: 
(i) 
where the Notes reference a single Index, that Averaging Date shall be the 
first succeeding Valid Date. If the first succeeding Valid Date has not 
occurred as of the eighth Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the 
original date that, but for the occurrence of another Averaging Date or 
Disrupted Day, would have been the final Averaging Date in respect of such 
Reference Date, then (A) that eighth Scheduled Trading Day shall be 
deemed to be that Averaging Date (irrespective of whether such day is a 
Disrupted Day or that eighth Scheduled Trading Day is already an 
Averaging Date), and (B) the Calculation Agent shall determine the relevant 
level or price for that Averaging Date in accordance with sub- paragraph (A) 
of paragraph (a)(4) above; and 
(ii) 
where the Notes reference a Basket of Indices, that Averaging Date for each 
Index not affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day shall be the 
originally designated Averaging Date and the Averaging Date for each Index 
affected by the occurrence of a Disrupted Day (each an "Affected Index") 
shall be the first succeeding Valid Date in relation to the Affected Index. If 
the first succeeding Valid Date in relation to the Affected Index has not 
occurred as of the eighth Scheduled Trading Day for the Affected Index 
immediately following the original date that, but for the occurrence of 
another Averaging Date or Disrupted Day, would have been the final 
Averaging Date in respect of such Reference Date, then (A) that eighth 
Scheduled Trading Day shall be deemed that Averaging Date for the 
Affected Index (irrespective of whether such day is a Disrupted Day or that 
eighth Scheduled Trading Day is already an Averaging Date), and (B) the 
Calculation Agent shall determine the level of the Affected Index as of the 
For personal use only
 
111 
Valuation Time on that Averaging Date in accordance with sub-paragraph 
(B) of paragraph (a)(4) above. 
For the purposes of this definition, "Valid Date" means in respect of an Index, a 
Scheduled Trading Day for such Index that is not a Disrupted Day for such Index and 
on which another Averaging Date in relation to the relevant Reference Date does not 
or is not deemed to occur. 
"Additional Disruption Events" means any of "Change in Law", "Hedging Disruption", 
"Increased Cost of Hedging", in each case, if specified as applicable in the applicable Pricing 
Supplement and any other event specified as an Additional Disruption Event in the applicable

Issuer and any Dealer to issue the Notes (the "Trade Date"), (a) due to the adoption or 
announcement of or any change in any applicable law or regulation (including, without 
limitation, any tax law) or (b) due to the promulgation of or any change in the interpretation by 
any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law or 
regulation (including any action taken by a taxing authority), the Issuer determines that (i) it 
has become illegal for the Issuer to hold, acquire, deal in or dispose of the Hedge Positions 
relating to the Notes or (ii) the Issuer will incur a materially increased cost in performing its 
obligations under the Notes (including, without limitation, due to any increase in tax liability, 
decrease in tax benefit or other adverse effect on its tax position). 
"Disrupted Day" means: 
(A) 
with respect to an Index other than a Multi-exchange Index, any Scheduled Trading 
Day for such Index on which a relevant Index Exchange or Related Index Exchange 
fails to open for trading during its regular trading session or on which a Market 
Disruption Event in respect of such Index has occurred; and 
(B) 
with respect to a Multi-exchange Index, any Scheduled Trading Day for such Index

Time unless such earlier closing time is announced by the relevant Index Exchange or 
Related Index Exchange at least one hour prior to the earlier of (a) the actual closing 
time for the regular trading session on the relevant Index Exchange or Related Index 
Exchange on such Index Exchange Business Day and (b) the submission deadline of 
orders to be entered into the relevant Index Exchange or Related Index Exchange 
system for execution at the Valuation Time on such Index Exchange Business Day; 
and 
(B) 
with respect to any Multi-exchange Index, the closure on any Index Exchange 
Business Day for such Index of the Index Exchange in respect of any securities 
underlying the Index or any Related Index Exchange for such Index prior to its 
Scheduled Closing Time unless such earlier closing is announced by the relevant 
Index Exchange or Related Index Exchange at least one hour prior to the earlier of: (i) 
the actual closing time for the regular trading session on the relevant Index Exchange 
For personal use only
 
112

the market value of the Notes following the event triggering the early redemption or 
cancellation, adjusted to take into account any costs, losses and expenses which are incurred 
(or expected to be incurred) by the Issuer in connection with the early redemption of the Notes, 
including (without duplication or limitation) hedging termination and funding breakage costs 
(whether actual or notional). In determining the Early Settlement Amount, the Calculation 
Agent may take into account prevailing market prices and/or proprietary pricing models, or 
where these pricing methods may not yield a commercially reasonable result, may estimate 
such Early Settlement Amount. The Early Settlement Amount will be determined by the 
Calculation Agent on or as soon as reasonably practicable following the event giving rise to 
the early redemption or cancellation of the Notes. For the purposes of calculating any Early 
Settlement Amount at any time for the purposes of Condition 11, the Calculation Agent will 
ignore the effect of the relevant Event of Default upon the market value of the Notes. 
"Index Exchange" means: 
(A) 
with respect to an Index other than a Multi-exchange Index, each exchange or 
quotation system specified as such for the Index in the applicable Pricing

temporary substitute exchange or quotation system as on the original Index 
Exchange; and 
(B) 
with respect to any Multi-exchange Index and in respect of each security underlying 
the Index, the principal stock exchange on which the security is principally traded, as

with respect to a Multi-exchange Index, any Scheduled Trading Day for such Index 
on which (i) the Index Sponsor for such Index publishes the level of the Index and (ii) 
each Related Index Exchange for such Index is open for trading during its regular 
trading session, notwithstanding any such Related Index Exchange closing prior to its 
Scheduled Closing Time. 
"Index Exchange Disruption" means: 
(A) 
with respect to an Index other than a Multi-exchange Index, any event (other than an 
Early Closure) that disrupts or impairs (as determined by the Calculation Agent) the

to the relevant date for payment that has or would have the effect of preventing or 
delaying the Issuer directly or indirectly from: 
(i) 
converting the Specified Currency into the Payment Currency (or vice versa) 
through customary legal channels; 
(ii) 
converting the Specified Currency into the Payment Currency (or vice versa)

Jurisdiction to accounts outside the Payment Jurisdiction; or 
(iv) 
delivering the Specified Currency between accounts inside the Payment 
Jurisdiction or to a party that is a non-resident of the Payment Jurisdiction;

increased amount that is incurred solely due to the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the 
Issuer shall not be deemed an Increased Cost of Hedging. 
"Index" means an index or indices (including, but not limited to, a proprietary index created by 
the Issuer or an associate of the Issuer) specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. 
"Index Sponsor" means, in relation to an Index, the corporation or entity that (a) is responsible

competent jurisdiction, in each case applicable to such payment; 
(ii)

in accordance with advice given as to such validity or applicability, at any time 
during the said period of 15 Business Days, by independent legal advisers; or  
(iii) 
to the extent that, immediately after the payment, the Issuer will not be Solvent (in 
which case such amount still accumulates and remains a debt owing to the Noteholder 
by the Issuer), or 
(B) 
an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order successfully 
appealed or permanently stayed within 30 Business Days), or an effective resolution 
is passed, for the winding up of the Issuer in Australia (but not elsewhere). 
(2) 
Consequences of an Event of Default 
If an Event of Default occurs in relation to the Notes: 
(A) 
under Condition 11(b)(1)(A), any Noteholder may institute proceedings: 
(i) 
to recover the amount the Issuer has failed to pay, provided that the Issuer may only

Issuer will be Solvent (in which case such amount still accumulates and remains a 
debt owing to the Noteholder by the Issuer); 
(ii) 
for specific performance of any other obligation in respect of the Note; or 
(iii) 
for the winding up of the Issuer in Australia (but not elsewhere); or

amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest 
For personal use only

A Noteholder has no right to accelerate payment or exercise any other remedy (including any 
right to sue for damages) as a consequence of any Event of Default other than as set out in this 
Condition 11(b)(2).

any) on such further Notes) and so that the same shall be consolidated and form a single series 
with the outstanding Notes of a particular Series (including the Notes of this Series). 
18 
Disapplication of Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999

20 
CMU Notes 
Where the Notes are CMU Notes, these Conditions shall be modified as specified in this 
Condition 20 and to the extent any provision of these Conditions is otherwise inconsistent with 
the terms of this Condition 20 it shall be deemed to have been modified accordingly. 
References in these Conditions to the Principal Paying Agent, the Registrar, a Paying Agent 
and a Transfer Agent shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be construed as a reference 
to the CMU lodging and paying agent appointed in relation to the CMU Notes as specified in 
the applicable Pricing Supplement (the "CMU Lodging and Paying Agent"). 
References in these Conditions to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg shall, unless the 
context otherwise requires, be construed as a reference to the Central Moneymarkets Unit 
Service operated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (the "CMU Service"). 
In this Condition "CMU Notes" means Notes denominated in any currency which the CMU 
Service accepts for settlement from time to time that are, or are intended to be, initially cleared 
through the CMU Service. 
Payments 
If a Note is held through the CMU Service, any payment that is made in respect of such Note 
shall be made at the direction of the bearer or the registered holder to the person(s) for whose 
account(s) interests in such Note are credited as being held through the CMU Service in 
accordance with the rules of the CMU Service (the "CMU Rules") at the relevant time as 
notified to the CMU Lodging and Paying Agent by the CMU Service in a relevant CMU 
Instrument Position Report (as defined in the CMU Rules) or any other relevant notification by 
the CMU Service (which notification, in either case, shall be conclusive evidence of the 
records of the CMU Service as to the identity of any accountholder and the principal amount 
of any Note credited to its account, save in the case of manifest error) (the "CMU 
Accountholders"). 
The CMU Accountholders at the direction of the bearer or the registered holder of a Note held 
through the CMU Service shall be the only persons entitled to receive payments in respect of 
such Note and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to, or to the order of, such CMU 
Accountholder, in respect of each amount so paid. Each of the persons shown in the records of 
the CMU Service as the beneficial holder of a particular nominal amount of CMU Notes must 
look solely to the CMU Service for its share of each payment so made by the Issuer to the 
order of the bearer or the registered holder of such Note. 
21 
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger 
Event 
This Condition 21 applies only to Subordinated Notes. 
(a) 
Non-Viability Trigger Event 
(1) 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies the Issuer in writing that it 
believes: 
For personal use only
 
127 
(A) 
an Exchange of all or some Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments 
of the CBA Group, is necessary because, without it, the Issuer would become non-
viable; or 
(B) 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, 
without it, the Issuer would become non-viable, 
(a "Non-Viability Trigger Event"). 
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital instruments which must be Exchanged, 
Written Down, converted or written down (as applicable). 
(2) 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer must Exchange in accordance with 
Conditions 21(b) and 21(c) such number of Notes (or, if it so determines, such percentage of 
the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note) as is equal (taking into account any 
conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities as referred to in Condition 21(a)(3)) to 
the aggregate face value of capital instruments which APRA has notified the Issuer must be 
Exchanged, converted or written down (or, if APRA has not so notified the Issuer, such 
number or, if the Issuer so determines, such percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount 
of each Note as is necessary to satisfy APRA that the Issuer will no longer be non-viable). If a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs under Condition 21(a)(1)(B), the Issuer must Exchange all 
Notes.  
(3) 
In determining the number of Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of 
each Note which must be Exchanged in accordance with this Condition 21, the Issuer will: 
(A) 
first, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 1 Securities 
whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be 
exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange of the Notes; 
(B) 
secondly, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 2 
Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, 
them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange of the Notes; and  
(C) 
thirdly, if exchange, conversion or write down of those securities is not sufficient, 
Exchange (in the case of the Notes) or exchange, convert or write down (in the case 
of any other Relevant Tier 2 Securities) on a pro-rata basis or in a manner that is 
otherwise, in the opinion of the Issuer, fair and reasonable, the Notes and any other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to 
require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down in that manner 
(subject to such adjustments as the Issuer may determine to take into account the 
effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares and any Notes or 
other Relevant Tier 2 Securities remaining on issue),  
but such determination will not impede the immediate Exchange of the relevant number of 
Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note (as the case may be).  
(4) 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, then: 
(A) 
the relevant number of Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of 
each Note, must be Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of the Non-Viability 
Trigger Event in accordance with Conditions 21(b) and 22 and the Exchange will be 
irrevocable; 
(B) 
the Issuer must give notice as soon as practicable that Exchange has occurred to the 
Registrar  and the Noteholders; 
(C) 
the notice must specify the date on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred; 
and 
For personal use only
 
128 
(D) 
the notice must specify the details of the Exchange process, including any details 
which were taken into account in relation to the effect on marketable parcels and 
whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, and the impact on any Notes remaining on issue. 
(5) 
Failure to undertake any of the steps in Conditions 21(a)(4) does not prevent, invalidate or 
otherwise impede Exchange or Write Down respectively. 
(6) 
For the purposes of the foregoing, where the specified currency of the face value of Relevant 
Tier 1 Securities, Relevant Tier 2 Securities and/or Notes (as applicable) is not the same, the 
Issuer may treat them as if converted into a single currency of the Issuer's choice at such rate 
of exchange as the Issuer in good faith considers reasonable. 
(b) 
Exchange 
(1) 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred and all or some of the Notes (or percentage of 
the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note) are required to be Exchanged in accordance 
with Condition 21(a), then: 
(A) 
Exchange of the relevant Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of 
each Note will occur in accordance with Conditions 21(a) and 22 immediately upon 
the date of occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event; and 
(B) 
the entry of the corresponding Note in each relevant Noteholders holding in the 
Register will, in each case, constitute an entitlement of that Noteholder (or, where 
Condition 22(j) applies, of the nominee) to the relevant number of Ordinary Shares 
(and, if applicable, also to any remaining balance of the Notes or remaining 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note), and the Issuer will 
recognise the Noteholder (or, where Condition 22(j) applies, the nominee) as having 
been issued the relevant Ordinary Shares for all purposes, 
in each case without the need for any further act or step by the Issuer, the Noteholder or any 
other person (and the Issuer will, as soon as possible thereafter and without delay on the part 
of the Issuer, take any appropriate procedural steps to record such Exchange, including the 
updating of the Register and the Ordinary Share register and seek quotation of Ordinary Shares 
issued on Exchange). 
(2) 
In relation to an Exchange, the Issuer shall notify the Registrar of the percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note that has been Exchanged and instruct the 
Registrar to reflect this Exchange in any relevant form of note or certificate and the Register so 
that the Outstanding Principal Amount of such Note is reduced by the relevant percentage.  If a 
definitive Note has been issued to a Noteholder in respect of such Note then, if the Issuer so 
requires, such Noteholder shall surrender such definitive Note to the Registrar and the 
Registrar shall deliver to the Noteholder a new definitive Note with a reduced Outstanding 
Principal Amount reflecting the Exchange. 
(3) 
For the avoidance of doubt: 
(A) 
nothing in this Condition 21(b) allows a payment to be made to a Noteholder upon 
Exchange; and 
(B) 
Exchange under this Condition 21(b) takes priority over a notice for redemption 
issued under Conditions 6(b), 6(c) or 6(d). 
(c) 
No further rights if Exchange cannot occur 
If for any reason, Exchange of any Note or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount 
of any Note required to be Exchanged under Condition 21(a) fails to take effect under 
Condition 21(b) and the Issuer has not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be 
issued in respect of such Exchange within five Ordinary Shares Business Days after the date of 
the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the relevant Noteholders rights 
(including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest, and the right to 
receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
For personal use only
 
129 
Amount of the Notes are immediately and irrevocably terminated ("Written Down"), and such 
termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the 
Non Viability Trigger Event. The Issuer must give notice as soon as practicable that Write 
Down has occurred to the Registrar and the Noteholders, and the notice must specify the date 
on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred. 
22 
General provisions applicable to Exchange 
This Condition 22 applies only to Subordinated Notes. 
(a) 
Exchange 
On the Subordinated Note Exchange Date, subject to Condition 21(c) and Condition 22(j), the 
following will apply: 
(A) 
The Issuer will allot and issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares for each 
Note (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note) required to 
be Exchanged. The Exchange Number is, subject always to the Exchange Number 
being no greater than the Maximum Exchange Number, each as calculated according 
to the formula specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement. 
(B) 
Each Noteholders rights (including to payment of interest) in relation to each Note 
that is being Exchanged (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each 
Note that is being Exchanged) will be immediately and irrevocably terminated for an 
amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note (or percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note) and the Issuer will apply that amount by 
way of payment for the subscription for the Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued 
under Condition 22(a)(A). Each Noteholder is taken to have irrevocably directed that 
any amount payable under this Condition 22(a) is to be applied as provided for in this 
Condition 22(a) and no Noteholder has any right to payment in any other way. 
(C) 
If the total number of additional Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued in respect 
of a Noteholders aggregate holding of Notes includes a fraction of an Ordinary 
Share, that fraction of an Ordinary Share will be disregarded. 
(D) 
Subject to Condition 22(j), where Notes are Exchanged, the Issuer will allot and issue 
the Ordinary Shares to the Noteholder on the basis that a Noteholders name and 
address set out in the Register (or, if not set out in the Register, otherwise held by the 
Registrar) are the name and address for entry into any register of title and delivery of 
any certificate or holding statement in respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on 
Exchange. 
(b) 
Adjustments to VWAP generally 
For the purposes of calculating the VWAP under Condition 22(a):  
(A) 
where, on some or all of the Ordinary Shares Business Days in the relevant VWAP 
Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted on ASX as cum dividend or cum any other 
distribution or entitlement and Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares after that 
date and those Ordinary Shares will no longer carry that dividend or any other 
distribution or entitlement, then the VWAP on the Ordinary Shares Business Days on 
which those Ordinary Shares have been quoted cum dividend or cum any other 
distribution or entitlement will be reduced by an amount (Cum Value) equal to:  
(i) 
in the case of a dividend or other distribution, the amount of that dividend or 
other distribution;  
(ii) 
in the case of any other entitlement that is not a dividend or other 
distribution under Condition 22(b)(A)(i) which is traded on ASX on any of 
those Ordinary Shares Business Days, the volume weighted average price of 
all such entitlements sold on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period on the 
Ordinary Shares Business Days on which those entitlements were traded 
For personal use only
 
130 
(excluding trades of the kind that would be excluded in determining VWAP 
under the definition of that term); or 
(iii) 
in the case of any other entitlement which is not traded on ASX during the 
VWAP Period, the value of the entitlement as reasonably determined by the 
Board; and 
(B) 
where, on some or all of the Ordinary Shares Business Days in the VWAP Period, 
Ordinary Shares have been quoted as ex dividend or ex any other distribution or 
entitlement, and Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares which would be 
entitled to receive the relevant dividend, distribution or entitlement, the VWAP on the 
Ordinary Shares Business Days on which those Ordinary Shares have been quoted ex 
dividend or ex any other distribution or entitlement will be increased by the Cum 
Value. 
(c) 
Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction 
(A) 
Where, during the relevant VWAP Period, there is a change to the number of 
Ordinary Shares on issue because the Ordinary Shares are reconstructed, 
consolidated, divided or reclassified (not involving any payment or other 
compensation to or by holders of Ordinary Shares) ("Reclassification") into a lesser 
or greater number, the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period which falls 
before the date on which trading in Ordinary Shares is conducted on a post 
Reclassification basis will be adjusted by multiplying it by the figure resulting from 
the application of the following formula: 
A 
B 
Where: 
"A" means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately before the 
Reclassification; and 
"B" means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately after the 
Reclassification. 
(B) 
Any adjustment made by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 22(c)(A) will be 
effective and binding on Noteholders under these Conditions and these Conditions 
will be construed accordingly. 
(C) 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Condition 22(c) allows a cash payment or 
other distribution to be made to or by a Noteholder as part of a Reclassification or as 
a result of a Reclassification. 
(d) 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP generally 
For the purposes of determining the Issue Date VWAP under Condition 22(a), adjustments 
will be made in accordance with Condition 22(b) and Condition 22(c) during the VWAP 
Period for the Issue Date VWAP. On and from the Issue Date, adjustments to the Issue Date 
VWAP: 
(A) 
may be made by the Issuer in accordance with Conditions 22(e) to 22(g) (inclusive); 
(B) 
if so made, will correspondingly cause an adjustment to the Maximum Exchange 
Number; and  
(C) 
if so made, will be effective and binding on Noteholders under these Conditions and 
these Conditions will be construed accordingly. 
(e) 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues 
For personal use only
 
131 
(A) 
Subject to Conditions 22(e)(B) and 22(e)(C), if the Issuer makes a pro-rata bonus 
issue of Ordinary Shares to holders of Ordinary Shares generally, the Issue Date 
VWAP will be adjusted immediately in accordance with the following formula: 
V = Vo x RD/(RD + RN) 
Where: 
"V" means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately after the application of this 
formula; 
"Vo" means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately prior to the application of 
this formula; 
"RD" means the number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately prior to the 
allotment of new Ordinary Shares pursuant to the bonus issue; and 
"RN" means the number of Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the bonus issue. 
(B) 
For the avoidance of doubt, Condition 22(e)(A) does not apply to Ordinary Shares 
issued as part of a bonus share plan, employee or executive share plan, executive 
option plan, share top up plan, share purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment plan. 
(C) 
For the purposes of this Condition, an issue will be regarded as a bonus issue 
notwithstanding that the Issuer does not make offers to some or all holders of 
Ordinary Shares with registered addresses outside Australia (or to whom an offer is 
otherwise subject to foreign securities laws), provided that in so doing the Issuer is 
not in contravention of the ASX Listing Rules. 
(f) 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction 
If, at any time after the Issue Date, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue 
because of a Reclassification into a lesser or greater number, the Issue Date VWAP will be 
adjusted by multiplying the Issue Date VWAP applicable on the Ordinary Shares Business 
Day immediately before the date of any such Reclassification by the following formula: 
A 
B 
where: 
"A" means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately before the 
Reclassification; and 
"B" means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately after the 
Reclassification. 
(g) 
No adjustment to Issue Date VWAP in certain circumstances 
Despite the provisions of Conditions 22(e) and 22(f), no adjustment will be made to the Issue 
Date VWAP where any such adjustment (rounded if applicable) would be less than one per 
cent. of the Issue Date VWAP then in effect. 
(h) 
Announcement of adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
The Issuer will notify any adjustment to the Issue Date VWAP under Conditions 22(d) to 22(f) 
(inclusive) to the Registrar and the Noteholders within 10 Ordinary Shares Business Days of 
the Issuer determining the adjustment and the adjustment will be final and binding. 
(i) 
Status and quotation of Ordinary Shares 
(A) 
Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange will rank equally with all other fully 
paid Ordinary Shares provided that the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares issued 
or arising from Exchange do not take effect until 5:00pm (Sydney time) on the 
Subordinated Note Exchange Date (or such other time required by APRA). 
For personal use only
 
132 
(B) 
The Issuer will use all reasonable endeavours to quote the Ordinary Shares issued on 
Exchange of the Notes on ASX. 
(j) 
Exchange where the Noteholder does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder 
(A) 
If Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note) of a 
Noteholder are required to be Exchanged and: 
(i) 
the Noteholder has notified the Issuer that it does not wish to receive 
Ordinary Shares as a result of Exchange, which notice may be given at any 
time on or after the Issue Date and prior to the Subordinated Note Exchange 
Date;  
(ii) 
the Noteholder is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder; or  
(iii) 
the Issuer has not received (for any reason whether or not due to the fault of 
that Noteholder) any information required by it in accordance with the 
Conditions so as to impede the Issuer issuing the Ordinary Shares to a 
Noteholder on the Subordinated Note Exchange Date, 
then, subject to Condition 22(j)(B), on the Subordinated Note Exchange Date, the 
Noteholders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Notes being Exchanged 
are immediately and irrevocably terminated and the Issuer will (subject to Condition 
22(j)(F)) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which 
nominee may not be the Issuer or a Related Entity of the Issuer) for no additional 
consideration on terms that, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares, the 
nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds 
to the relevant Noteholder (unless, because the Noteholder is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder, the nominee is deemed to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, 
in which case such issue shall occur as soon as practicable after the nominee ceases to 
be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder). 
(B) 
If Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note) of a 
Noteholder are required to be Exchanged and the Noteholder is the operator of a 
Clearing System or a nominee for a common depository for any one or more Clearing 
Systems (such operator or nominee for a common depository acting in such capacity 
as is specified in the rules and regulations of the relevant Clearing System or Clearing 
Systems) and the rules and regulations of that Clearing System do not permit the 
Clearing System or its nominee to hold Ordinary Shares, then, on the Subordinated 
Note Exchange Date, the Noteholders rights (including to payment of the

Issuer) in relation to such Notes being Exchanged are immediately and irrevocably 
terminated and the Issuer will (subject to Condition 22(j)(F)) issue the Exchange 
Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee may not be the Issuer or a 
Related Entity of the Issuer) for no additional consideration on terms that they are

(C) 
Where Ordinary Shares are issued to one or more nominees in accordance with 
Condition 22(j)(B), each person who is for the time being shown in the records of the 
relevant Clearing System or Clearing Systems as the holder of the corresponding 
Notes immediately prior to Exchange (each a "Clearing System Participant", in which

Outstanding Principal Amount of such Notes standing to the account of any person 
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) 
may, no later than 30 days following the relevant Subordinated Note Exchange Date 
(the "Clearing System Cut-off Date"), provide to the Issuer and the relevant nominee: 
For personal use only
 
133 
(i) 
its name and address for entry into any register of title and receipt of any 
certificate or holding statement in respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on 
Exchange; 
(ii) 
the Noteholders security account details in CHESS or such other account to 
which the Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange are to be credited; and 
(iii) 
such other information as is reasonably requested by the Issuer, 
and, if it does so, the nominee will transfer the relevant Ordinary Shares to the 
Clearing System Participant as soon as possible thereafter. 
(D) 
If a Clearing System Participant: 
(i) 
fails to provide the information required by Condition 22(j)(C) by the 
Clearing System Cut-off Date; 
(ii) 
notifies the Issuer that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares on or prior 
to the Clearing System Cut-off Date; or 
(iii) 
would be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder if the Clearing System 
Participants name had been entered in a Register as the owner of the Notes 
immediately prior to Exchange, 
then, with effect from the Clearing System Cut-off Date, the Clearing System 
Participant will cease to be entitled to receive the relevant Ordinary Shares and, at the 
first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares after the Clearing System Cut-off Date, 
the relevant nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the 
Attributable Proceeds to the Clearing System Participant. 
(E) 
Where a nominee is to be issued with Ordinary Shares under this Condition 22(j), on 
and from the date of issue of those Ordinary Shares, the relevant Notes (or percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note) are taken to have been Exchanged 
and the only rights of the Noteholders or the Clearing System Participant (as the case 
may be) in respect of such Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount 
of each Note) are:  
(i) 
where Conditions 22(j)(A) or 22(j)(D) applies, to require the nominee to pay 
it the Attributable Proceeds or  
(ii) 
where Condition 22(j)(C) applies and the Clearing System Participant 
complies with the conditions of that Condition, to require the nominee to 
effect a transfer of those Ordinary Shares to the Clearing System Participant. 
(F) 
If, where Condition 22(j) applies: 
(i) 
the Exchange fails to take effect; and 
(ii) 
the Issuer has not otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the relevant nominee 
within five Ordinary Shares Business Days after the date of the occurrence 
of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then the Noteholders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) are immediately and 
irrevocably terminated in accordance with Condition 21(c). 
(k) 
Exchange of a percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount 
If, under these Conditions, it is necessary to Exchange a percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount, this Condition 22 will apply to the Exchange as if references to the 
Outstanding Principal Amount were references to the relevant percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount to be Exchanged. 
For personal use only
 
134 
For the avoidance of doubt, if, under these Conditions, it is not necessary to Exchange all of 
the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Note, and either (a) a Noteholder is the operator of 
a Clearing System or nominee for a common depository for any one or more Clearing Systems 
or (b) an Exchange of some only of the Notes could result in the Exchange being applied 
among Noteholders or Clearing System Participants (as applicable) other than on a pro-rata 
basis, the Exchange will be effected by the relevant percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Note being Exchanged.

and New Zealand. It also has operations throughout Asia, and in the United Kingdom, Malta and the 
United States. The fact that as at 30 April 2019, the Bank was Australias largest bank in terms of 
housing loans and retail (household) deposits is sourced from APRA monthly Banking Statistics April 
2019 (issued 31 May 2019) (Tables 2 and 4). The Bank confirms that such information has been 
accurately reproduced and that, so far as it is aware and is able to ascertain from information published 
by APRA, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or 
misleading.  
On 13 June 2000, the Bank acquired 100 per cent. of Colonial, significantly increasing its wealth 
management capabilities. The Bank conducts its operations primarily through the following business 
units:

Recent Developments 
Legal Proceedings  
On 3 August 2017, AUSTRAC commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia 
against the Bank, concerning contraventions of four provisions of the AML/CTF Act. On 20 June 2018 
the Federal Court of Australia approved the agreement between the Bank and AUSTRAC to resolve 
these proceedings. Accordingly, the Bank recognised a A$700 million expense in its financial 
statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2018. 
The Bank has also acted to strengthen financial crime capabilities more broadly, and has invested 
significantly recognising the crucial role that it plays, including through its Program of Action with 
coverage across all aspects of financial crime (including AML/CTF, sanctions and anti-bribery and 
corruption) and all business units. 
As a result of the Banks investment in its financial crimes environment, the Bank is today in a better 
position to ensure that it complies with its AML/CTF obligations in detecting, deterring and reporting 
financial crime.  However, there is still a significant amount of work to be done. The Bank is committed 
to ensuring that the necessary work is done as quickly as possible.  
The Group may in the future be subject to additional regulatory actions, litigation, investigations and 
governmental proceedings emanating from the conduct the subject of the proceedings, which could 
result in penalties and costs, reputational damage, contractual damage claims, class actions or other 
claims by impacted the Banks stakeholders, which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups 
business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Although the Bank provides updates to AUSTRAC and the Groups other regulators on the Program of 
Action, there is no assurance that AUSTRAC or the Groups other regulators will agree that the 
Groups Program of Action will be adequate or that the Program of Action will effectively enhance the 
Groups compliance programs. 
In September 2017, following the commencement of the civil proceedings against the Bank by 
AUSTRAC, ASIC launched an investigation in relation to the Banks disclosure in respect of the 
allegations raised in connection with the AUSTRAC proceedings. ASIC is investigating, among other 
things, whether the officers and directors at the Bank complied with their obligations under the 
Australian Corporations Act. The Bank continues to engage with ASIC in respect of the investigation 
and respond to requests made by ASIC. It is currently not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of 
this investigation, if any, on the Bank. The Bank has provided for the costs expected to be incurred in 
relation to this investigation.  
On 28 August 2017, APRA announced it would establish the Prudential Inquiry.  The Prudential 
Inquiry considered, amongst other things, whether the Groups organisational structure, governance, 
financial objectives, remuneration and accountability frameworks conflicted with sound risk 
management and compliance outcomes. A panel was appointed on 8 September 2017 to conduct the 
Prudential Inquiry, comprising of Dr John Laker AO, Jillian Broadbent AO and Professor Graeme 
Samuel AC (the Panel). 
Following the Prudential Inquiry, APRA released the Final Report. The Final Report made a number of 
findings regarding the complex interplay of organisational and cultural factors within the Bank and the 
need for enhanced management of non-financial risks. In response to the Final Report, the Bank has 
acknowledged that it will implement all of the recommendations and has agreed to adjust its minimum 
capital requirements by an additional A$1 billion (risk weighted assets A$12.5 billion) until such time 
as the recommendations are implemented to APRAs satisfaction. The effect of this adjustment equates 
to 28 basis points of CET1 capital and reduces the Banks CET1 ratio as at 30 September 2018 from 
10.3 per cent. to 10 per cent. 
The Bank has entered into an Enforceable Undertaking under which the Banks remedial action plan 
(the Remedial Action Plan) in response to the Final Report is monitored by APRA.  
The Remedial Action Plan provides a detailed program of change outlining how the Bank will improve 
the way it runs its business, manages risk, and works with regulators. The Remedial Action Plan 
provides a comprehensive assurance framework, with Promontory Australasia (Sydney) having been 
appointed as the independent reviewer and is required to report to APRA on the Groups progress 
regularly, with the first report being submitted on 28 September 2018 and the second report on 20 
December 2018. Both these reports have been released by the Bank. Promontory Australasia (Sydney) 
has noted that the Remedial Action Plan program of work remains on track and the Banks commitment 
to implementing the Prudential Inquirys recommendations in a timely and comprehensive way 
continued to be strong with all milestones on schedule to be delivered by the due dates. A third report 
was submitted to APRA on 30 April 2019. This report has yet to be released by the Bank. 
While the Bank is not currently aware of any other enforcement action by other domestic or foreign 
regulators relating to the allegations raised by AUSTRAC (or similar matters) as of the date of this 
Information Memorandum, there can be no assurance that the Bank will not be subject to such 
enforcement actions in the future. The settlement in connection with the proceedings launched by 
AUSTRAC, or any other formal or informal proceeding or investigation by other government or 
regulatory agencies (domestic or foreign), may result in additional litigation or proceedings by other 
regulators or private parties. 
This risk is evidenced by the shareholder class action proceeding which was commenced in the Federal 
Court of Australia on 9 October 2017 alleging breaches of the Banks continuous disclosure obligations 
and misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the subject matter of the civil penalty proceedings 
For personal use only
 
142 
brought by AUSTRAC. It is alleged that the Banks shareholders who acquired an interest in the Banks 
ordinary shares between 1 July 2015 and 3 August 2017 suffered loss caused by the alleged conduct.  
A similar subject matter shareholder class action was filed on 29 June 2018 by law firm Phi Finney 
McDonald on behalf of a group of shareholders who acquired an interest in the Banks ordinary shares 
between 16 June 2014 and 3 August 2017. 
The Bank intends to vigorously defend both shareholder class actions. At this time it is not possible to 
reliably estimate the possible financial impact on the Group of class actions. Accordingly, no loss 
provision has been made, although the Bank has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred to 
defend these claims. 
Defence of Superannuation Class Action 
On 9 October 2018, Slater and Gordon Lawyers filed a class action claim against the Bank and CFSIL 
in the Victorian Registry of the Federal Court of Australia.  The Bank is the second respondent to this 
claim.  The claim relates to investment in cash and deposit options (which are the Banks cash and 
deposit products) in Colonial First State FirstChoice Superannuation Trust and Commonwealth 
Essential Super. The main allegation is that members with these options in the funds received lower 
interest rates on them than they would have had CFSIL put them in equivalent products with the highest 
interest rates obtainable on the market. It is alleged that the Bank was involved in CFSILs breaches as 
trustee of the funds and CFSILs breaches as Responsible Entity of the underlying managed investment 
schemes. It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on the 
Group.  Both the Bank and CFSIL deny the allegations and filed a defence to the claim. However Slater 
and Gordon Lawyers have made further amendments to the claim and the Bank and CFSIL filed a 
defence to the amended claim on 7 June 2019. The amendments introduce additional allegations 
relating to another term deposit and a breach of trust in respect of adviser commissions; however the 
commissions claim is made against CFSIL only.  The Group has made provision for the legal costs 
estimated to be incurred in the defence of the claim. 
The Royal Commission 
The Royal Commission was established on 14 December 2017 and was authorised to inquire into 
misconduct by financial service entities (including the Bank). Seven rounds of hearings into misconduct 
in the banking and financial services industry were held throughout 2018, covering a variety of topics 
including consumer and business lending, financial advice, superannuation, insurance and a policy 
round. The Royal Commissions final report was delivered on 1 February 2019. The final report 
included 76 policy recommendations to the Australian Government and findings in relation to the case 
studies investigated during the hearings, with a number of referrals being made to regulators for 
misconduct by financial institutions, which is expected to result in heightened levels of enforcement 
action across the industry.  
The 76 recommendations covered many of the Banks business areas, and also canvassed the role of the 
regulators and the approach to be taken to customer focus, culture and remuneration. The 
recommendations regarding the role of regulators, in particular the litigate first approach for breaches 
of financial services law, will likely lead to a change in the Banks regulator relationships and the Bank 
can expect an increase of activity, costs and reputational impact in this area. The Bank released a 
statement to the ASX on 8 March 2019 welcoming the final report and committing to actions to deliver 
on the recommendations.  
 
Other industry-wide regulatory reforms and political developments 
Examples of significant regulatory reform under development in Australia include a review of Open 
Banking, APRA's proposals to revise the capital framework for ADIs and Treasury Laws Amendment 
(Design and Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention Powers) Act 2019. 
In late 2017, the Australian Government announced it would legislate an economy-wide Consumer 
Data Right to Open Banking. The Australian Government has decided to phase in Open Banking with

the major banks expected to make data available on credit and debit card, deposit and transaction 
accounts from July 2019, before expanding to other banking products (e.g. mortgage) and sharing of 
consumer data between banks and accredited third parties (at the direction of the consumer). These 
reforms are intended to increase competition in the financial sector and improve customer outcomes. 
Consumer Data Right laws have not yet been passed by the Federal Parliament in Australia. Increased 
competition resulting from Open Banking may adversely impact the Issuers business and financial 
condition. 
APRA proposal for increasing the loss-absorbing capacity of ADIs  
On 8 November 2018 the Group noted the release of the discussion paper by APRA (the APRA 
Paper) on the loss-absorbing capacity of ADIs.  
The APRA Paper outlines APRAs proposed approach for loss-absorbing capacity, consistent with the 
Financial System Inquiry recommendation to implement a framework sufficient to facilitate the orderly 
resolution of Australian ADIs.  
The APRA Paper recommends that the Australian regime be established under the existing capital 
framework, rather than by introducing new forms of loss-absorbing instruments. 
For the four Australian major banks, including the Group, APRA proposes an increase in the total 
capital requirement of between four and five percentage points of RWA, with the requirements taking 
full effect from 2023. APRA further notes that it is anticipated that the banks would satisfy this 
requirement predominantly with additional Tier 2 capital.  
Based on the Banks RWA of A$445 billion as at 31 December 2018, and all other things being equal, 
the additional four to five percentage points represents an incremental increase of approximately A$18 
billion to A$22 billion of the Groups total capital. The Group expects that this requirement would 
result in a decrease in other forms of funding. The ultimate cost will be determined by market factors 
and the final framework issued by APRA.  
It is expected that APRA will finalise its requirements in late 2019. 
Wealth Management and Mortgage Broking Businesses Update  
On 14 March 2019, the Group advised of an update on its remediation and demerger plans for its wealth 
management and mortgage broking businesses. The update followed the release of the Groups full 
response to implementing the recommendations from the Royal Commission.  
The Group is prioritising the implementation of these recommendations, refunding customers and 
remediating past issues. Accordingly, the Group has suspended preparations for the demerger in order 
to support its focus on these priorities.  
The Group remains committed to its strategy to become a simpler, better bank, including ultimately the 
exit of its wealth management and mortgage broking businesses. 
Trading Update for the Quarter Ended 31 March 2019  Net Profit 
On 13 May 2019, the Group announced its results for the quarter ended 31 March 2019. These results 
included A$714 million in pre-tax additional customer remediation provisions (A$500 million post tax), 
which impacted the Groups net profit. Of these provisions, A$704 million was recognised in operating 
expenses (continuing operations) and A$10 million was recognised in discontinued operations. 
Unaudited net profit after tax (statutory basis) was approximately A$1.75 billion, with unaudited net 
profit after tax (cash basis) from continuing operations of approximately A$1.70 billion, a decrease 
from approximately A$2.30 billion and approximately A$2.35 billion, being the simple average of the

quarters ended 30 September 2018 and 31 December 2018, respectively. Unaudited net profit after tax 
(cash basis) from continuing operations decreased by 28 per cent. 
The unaudited net profit after tax (statutory basis) and unaudited net profit after tax (cash basis) figures 
have been rounded to the nearest A$50 million. 
Enforceable Undertaking accepted by the Australian Information Commissioner 
On 27 June 2019, the Australian Information Commissioner announced that it has accepted an 
Enforceable Undertaking (the Undertaking) offered by the Bank. The Undertaking underpins 
execution of further enhancements to the management and retention of customer personal information 
within the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries. 
The Undertaking follows the Banks ongoing work to address two incidents; one relating to the disposal 
of magnetic data tapes containing historical customer statements; and the other relating to internal user 
access to certain systems and applications containing customer personal information. The Bank 
reported both incidents to the OAIC in 2016 and 2018 respectively and has since been working to 
address these incidents. 
The Bank has found no evidence to date, as a result of these incidents, that its customers personal 
information was compromised, or that there have been any instances of unauthorised access by the 
Bank employees or third parties. 
The Banks commitments in the Undertaking include reviewing and implementing further 
enhancements to: 
 
internal privacy policies, procedures and record retention standards; 
 
internal user access controls on systems and applications that hold personal information; and 
 
the privacy risk management and monitoring processes that apply to service providers to the 
Bank and certain of its subsidiaries. 
The Undertaking provides the Bank with 90 days to develop and submit to the OAIC a work plan, and 
timetable of work that the Bank will complete to meet its obligations under the Undertaking.

Description of the Shares 
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares (ISIN: AU000000CBA7) may be issued to holders of Subordinated Notes by way of 
Exchange. Ordinary Shares may also be issued to a nominee to hold for sale for the benefit of a holder 
of Subordinated Notes if Exchange occurs and the holder of Subordinated Notes has notified the Issuer 
that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder. Any Ordinary 
Shares issued to holders of Subordinated Notes by way of Exchange will be fully paid and will rank 
equally with Ordinary Shares already on issue in all respects. 
Transfers 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, transfers of Ordinary Shares are not effective until 
registered. Ordinary Shares are transferrable, subject to the ASX Listing Rules and the Constitution of 
the Issuer dated 13 November 2008 (incorporating amendments up to and including all amendments 
passed at the Annual General Meeting on 13 November 2008) (the "Constitution") and the right of the 
directors of the Issuer to refuse to register a transfer of Ordinary Shares in limited circumstances. 
Unless otherwise required by law or the Constitution, the Issuer is entitled to treat the registered holder 
as the absolute owner of a share. Ordinary Shares held by a trustee may, with the directors consent, be 
identified as being subject to the relevant trust. 
Except in limited circumstances, the Issuer is not bound to register more than three persons as joint 
holders of an Ordinary Share. The Issuer does not issue share certificates unless required by law or the 
ASX Listing Rules. 
Restrictions apply in respect of persons who become entitled to Ordinary Shares by reason of a holders 
death, bankruptcy or mental incapacity. In the case of the death of a holder, the survivor or survivors 
jointly registered as shareholders and the legal personal representatives of a sole holder are the only 
persons the Issuer will recognise as having title to the members interest in the shares. 
Dividends 
Holders of Ordinary Shares may receive dividends if the directors determine that a dividend is payable. 
The Issuer may not pay a dividend unless the Issuers assets exceed its liabilities, the payment of the 
dividend is fair and reasonable to holders of Ordinary Shares as a whole and the payment does not 
materially prejudice the ability of the Issuer to pay its creditors. Payment may also be subject to the 
rights of holders of securities carrying preferred rights. The Issuer pays shareholders with registered 
addresses in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom cash dividends by direct credit. If a direct 
credit payment instruction is not provided, the dividend will be held in a non-interest bearing account. 
The Issuer also has a dividend reinvestment plan for eligible shareholders. The directors of the Issuer 
determine whether or not the dividend reinvestment plan operates for each dividend and their decision 
is announced to ASX. 
Winding up 
On winding up of the Issuer, holders of Ordinary Shares will participate in the division of any surplus 
assets of the Issuer (subject to the rights of holders of shares carrying preferred rights). 
Meetings 
Holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive notice of, attend and, subject to the Constitution, to 
vote in person, by representative, attorney or proxy at general meetings of the Issuer. 
On a show of hands, each holder (regardless of the number of shares held) has one vote. On a poll, each 
holder has one vote for each fully paid Ordinary Share held. 
Issue of further shares 
The directors of the Issuer control the issue of shares. Subject to the Corporations Act and ASX Listing 
Rules, the directors may issue further shares, and grant rights or options over shares, on such terms as 
they think fit. 
For personal use only
 
154 
Restrictions of ownership of Ordinary Shares 
Australian laws including financial sector and foreign ownership and takeover laws impose certain 
limitations on the right of persons to hold, own or vote on Ordinary Shares. 
Variation of the Constitution 
The Issuer may seek approval by special resolution of holders of Ordinary Shares (passed by at least 75 
per cent. of the votes cast by members entitled to vote on the resolution) to vary the Constitution. 
For personal use only
 
155 
Subscription and Sale 
The Dealers have in an Amended and Restated Programme Agreement dated 3 July 2019 (as modified 
and/or supplemented and/or restated from time to time, the "Programme Agreement") agreed with the

registration requirements of the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given 
to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.

given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treasury regulations promulgated 
thereunder.

be required to represent and agree, that it will not offer, sell or deliver Exempt Notes (i) as part of their

will not make (directly or indirectly) any offer or invitation in Australia or any offer or 
invitation which is received in Australia in relation to the issue, sale or purchase of any 
Exempt Notes; and 
(b) 
has not distributed or published, and will not distribute or publish, any information 
memorandum, advertisement, disclosure document or other offering material relating to the

unless (i) the aggregate consideration payable by each offeree or invitee is at least A$500,000 for the 
Exempt Notes or its foreign currency equivalent (in either case disregarding moneys, if any, lent by the 
Issuer or other person offering the Exempt Notes or its associates (within the meaning of those

disclosure to investors in accordance with Part 6D.2 or Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act, (ii) the offer or

(other than one acting in the capacity of a dealer, manager or underwriter in relation to the placement of 
the Exempt Notes or in the capacity of a clearing house, custodian, funds manager or responsible entity 
of a registered scheme).

Australia or, alternatively, is a resident of Australia that acquires the Exempt Notes in carrying on 
business at or through a permanent establishment outside of Australia. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the selling restrictions immediately above concerning section 128F of the 
Australian Tax Act apply irrespective of the jurisdiction in which the Exempt Notes are being offered 
or sold.

otherwise under any regulated offer, in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 of New 
Zealand (the FMCA). In particular, no product disclosure statement or limited disclosure document

directly or indirectly offer, sell or deliver any Exempt Note in New Zealand and it will not distribute 
any offering memorandum or advertisement in relation to any offer of Exempt Notes, in New Zealand

paragraph above.

be required to represent and agree, that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any Exempt 
Notes to persons whom it believes to be:

New Zealand income tax purposes) in New Zealand and hold the Exempt Notes for the 
purposes of a business carried on through that fixed establishment; or 
(c) 
a registered bank engaged in business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. 
unless such persons certify that they hold a valid certificate of exemption (or other evidence of exempt 
status acceptable to the Issuer and/or the relevant Paying Agent) for New Zealand resident withholding 
tax purposes or otherwise have exempt status in respect of resident withholding tax and provide a New 
Zealand tax file number to such Dealer (in which event the Dealer shall provide details thereof to the 
Issuer or to a Paying Agent). 
Republic of Italy 
The offering of the Exempt Notes has not been registered pursuant to Italian securities legislation and, 
accordingly, each Dealer has represented and agreed, and each further Dealer appointed under the

Article 100 of the Financial Services Act and Article 34-ter of Regulation No. 11971.

Australian Taxation 
The following is a summary of the Australian taxation treatment, at the date of this 
Information Memorandum, of payments of interest on Exempt Notes and certain other matters. 
It is not exhaustive and does not deal with the position of certain classes of holders of an 
Exempt Note (such as dealers in securities). Prospective holders of Exempt Notes should be 
aware that the particular terms of issue of any series of Exempt Notes may affect the tax 
treatment of that and other series of Exempt Notes. The following is a general guide and 
should be treated with appropriate caution. In particular, the Australian taxation treatment of 
Index Linked Notes or Dual Currency Notes may be different to that described below. Holders 
of Exempt Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their professional 
advisers. 
References to interest include amounts in the nature of or in substitution for interest. 
The requirements for obtaining an exemption from Australian interest withholding tax set out 
in section 128F of the Australian Tax Act include: 
(i) 
the issuer must be a resident of Australia when it issues the Exempt Notes and when 
interest is paid; and 
(ii) 
the issue of the Exempt Notes must satisfy a public offer test containing five basic 
alternatives designed to ensure that lenders in capital markets are aware that the issuer 
is offering Exempt Notes for issue. 
Where practicable, the Issuer intends to issue Exempt Notes in a manner which will satisfy 
these requirements. 
The public offer test 
In summary, the alternatives to satisfy the public offer test are: 
(i) 
offers to 10 or more professional market financiers, investors or dealers who are not 
associates of each other; 
(ii) 
offers to 100 or more potential investors; 
(iii) 
offers of listed Exempt Notes; 
(iv) 
offers as a result of negotiations being initiated via electronic or other market sources; 
or 
(v) 
offers to dealers, managers or underwriters who by agreement with the issuer offer 
the Exempt Notes for sale within 30 days by one of the preceding methods. 
The issue of a Global Note by one of these methods will satisfy the public offer test. 
Associates of issuer 
The public offer test will not be satisfied if, at the time of issue, the issuer knew or had 
reasonable grounds to suspect that the Exempt Notes, or an interest in the Exempt Notes, was 
being, or would later be, acquired either directly or indirectly by an Offshore Associate of the 
issuer (other than one acting in the capacity of a dealer, manager or underwriter in relation to 
the placement of the Exempt Notes or in the capacity of a clearing house, custodian, funds 
manager or responsible entity of a registered scheme). 
Moreover, the section 128F exemption will not be available if, at the time of payment, the 
issuer knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect that interest in respect of an Exempt Note is

165 
to be paid to an Offshore Associate of the issuer other than one receiving the payment in the 
capacity of a clearing house, paying agent, custodian, funds manager or responsible entity of a 
registered scheme. The Conditions of the Exempt Notes provide that in these circumstances 
the Issuer will not be required to gross up interest payments. 
ACCORDINGLY, EXEMPT NOTES MUST NOT BE PURCHASED BY OFFSHORE 
ASSOCIATES OF THE ISSUER OTHER THAN THOSE ACTING IN THE 
PERMITTED CAPACITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE 
As a result of the issue of Global Notes, rights conferred by Euroclear or Clearstream, 
Luxembourg in relation to the Exempt Notes will be created in favour of the Noteholders. 
Section 126 of the Australian Tax Act imposes a type of withholding tax at the rate of 45 per 
cent. on the payment of interest on bearer notes if the issuer fails to disclose the names and 
addresses of the holders to the Australian Taxation Office. Section 126 does not apply to the 
payment of interest on notes held by non-residents who do not carry on business at or through 
a permanent establishment in Australia where the issue of those notes satisfied the 
requirements of section 128F of the Australian Tax Act or interest withholding tax is payable. 
However, the operation of section 126 in relation to notes held in some circumstances is 
unclear. 
The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia may give a direction under 
section 255 of the Australian Tax Act or section 260-5 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation 
Administration Act 1953 or any similar provision requiring the issuer to deduct from any 
payment to any other party (including any holder of Exempt Notes) any amount in respect of 
tax payable by that other party. 
The Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 of the Commonwealth of Australia contains provisions 
governing the taxation of financial arrangements (referred to as "the TOFA regime") which 
may apply to the Exempt Notes. However, the law that governed the taxation of financial 
arrangements before the introduction of the TOFA regime will continue to apply to Exempt 
Notes held by taxpayers that are not subject to the TOFA regime because they do not meet 
certain threshold requirements. In any case, the TOFA regime does not contain any measures 
that override the exemption from Australian interest withholding tax available under section 
128F of the Australian Tax Act in respect of interest payable on the Exempt Notes. 
8 
The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax 
On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commissions 
Proposal") for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax ("FTT") in Belgium, 
Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the 
"participating Member States"). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. 
The Commissions Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain 
dealings in the Exempt Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain 
circumstances.  Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No. 
1287/2006 are expected to be exempt. 
Under the Commissions Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons 
both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to 
certain dealings in Exempt Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least 
one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be 
deemed to be, "established" in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, 
including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) 
where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating 
Member State. 
However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member 
States.  It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains 
unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of Exempt Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in 
relation to the FTT. 
9 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Withholding 
Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known 
as FATCA, a foreign financial institution (as defined by FATCA) may be required to 
withhold on certain payments it makes (foreign passthru payments) to persons that fail to 
meet certain certification, reporting or related requirements. The Issuer is classified as a 
foreign financial institution.  A number of jurisdictions (including Australia) have entered into, 
or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to 
implement FATCA (IGAs), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their 
jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution 
in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA 
from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and 
IGAs to instruments such as Exempt Notes, including whether withholding would ever be 
required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as 
Exempt Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change.  Even if withholding would be 
required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as 
Exempt Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to the date that is two years after the 
date on which final regulations defining passthru payments are published in the U.S. Federal 
Register and Exempt Notes issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on 
which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the U.S. Federal 
Register generally would be grandfathered for purposes of FATCA withholding unless 
materially modified after such date (including by reason of a substitution of the issuer).  
However, if additional Exempt Notes (as described under Terms and ConditionsFurther 
Issues) that are not distinguishable from previously issued Exempt Notes are issued after the 
expiration of the grandfathering period and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then 
withholding agents may treat all Exempt Notes, including the Exempt Notes offered prior to 
the expiration of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA.  Holders 
should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment 
in Exempt Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an 
IGA with respect to payments on the Exempt Notes, no person will be required to pay 
additional amounts as a result of the withholding. 
The impact of FATCA for Australian financial institutions will also depend on associated 
guidance issued by the Australian Taxation Office. Prospective investors should consult their 
tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to payments they may receive in 
connection with the Exempt Notes. 
10 
Common Reporting Standard 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Standard for Automatic 
Exchange of Financial Account Information (the CRS) requires certain financial institutions 
to report information regarding certain accounts to their local tax authority and follow related 
due diligence procedures. Noteholders may be requested to provide certain information and 
certifications to ensure compliance with the CRS. A jurisdiction that has signed a competent 
authority agreement may provide this information to other jurisdictions that have signed a 
competent authority agreement. 
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how the CRS may apply to such 
investor. 
11 
Post-issuance information 
Save as set out in the Pricing Supplement, the Issuer does not intend to provide any post-
issuance information in relation to any issues of Exempt Notes. 
12 
Dealers transacting with the Issuer 
For personal use only
 
167 
Certain of the Dealers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in 
investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services 
for the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Certain of the Dealers and 
their affiliates may have positions, deal or make markets in Exempt Notes issued under the 
Programme, related derivatives and reference obligations, including (but not limited to) 
entering into hedging strategies on behalf of the Issuer and its affiliates, investor clients, or as 
principal in order to manage their exposure, their general market risk, or other trading 
activities. 
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Dealers and their affiliates 
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or 
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own 
account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may 
involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or the Issuers affiliates. Certain of the 
Dealers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their 
credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. 
Typically, such Dealers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into 
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short 
positions in securities, including potentially Exempt Notes issued under the Programme. Any 
such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Exempt Notes issued under the 
Programme. The Dealers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations 
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial 
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short 
positions in such securities and instruments.

(the "Prospectus Directive") will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive, as 
implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of

to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus 
pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the 
Issuer nor any Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of Notes in

ASX announcement 
CDPP proceedings against CommInsure 
Friday 4 October 2019 (Sydney): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today announced The Colonial Mutual 
Life Assurance Society (CMLA) (CommInsure), a subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, was this morning served by 
the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to criminal proceedings against CMLA for 87 alleged 
contraventions of the anti-hawking provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The alleged contraventions relate to 
telephone sales of Simple Life insurance products by CMLA in the period 7 October 2014 to 16 December 2014, a

Group Securities Trading Policy 
 
1 | Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
Effective: 09 October 2019 
 
Purpose and scope 
 
 
This Group policy sets out when our Non-Executive Directors, Employees, 
Contractors, Secondees and Associates of Specified Persons, may Deal in Securities. 
It aims to ensure compliance with Insider Trading laws (in and outside of Australia) 
and to protect the Group from reputational damage arising from Insider Trading. 
It puts in place a specific framework for the disclosure and management of Dealing 
in Group Securities to address the risk of Insider Trading occurring by Specified 
Persons and their Associates Dealing in our Group Securities.  This risk has the 
potential to lead to poor outcomes for our communities and shareholders and cause 
reputational damage, regulatory action, financial penalty or legal recourse against 
the Group.  
 
This policy complements Business Unit or Support Unit (BU/SU) specific policies that 
apply in addition to this Group policy and the supporting Group procedure. 
For those parts of the Group that are impacted by laws, regulatory requirements or 
contractual obligations that conflict with this policy, the more stringent standard 
applies. 
Policy statement 
 
If you are aware of Inside Information, you are prohibited from Dealing in relevant 
Securities, causing other people to Deal in those Securities and giving that 
information to other people if you know or should know they would, or would be 
likely to Deal in those Securities. You must not Deal in Securities if the proposed 
Dealing could be perceived as taking advantage of your position for personal gain.  
When you want to Deal in Group Securities you must comply with the requirements 
of this policy and the supporting Group procedure. 
If you are a Specified Person, additional requirements apply to you and your 
Associates, including only Dealing in Group Securities during Trading Windows unless 
you have obtained an exemption, holding Group Securities for at least thirty days 
and not using Group Securities in margin lending arrangements.  Your Associates 
must comply with this policy and you must take reasonable steps to ensure they do. 
Policy requirements 
Requirements 
that apply to Non-
Executive 
Directors, 
Employees, 
Contractors and 
Secondees 
1. (No Insider Trading) If you are aware of Inside Information regarding any 
Securities (not only Group Securities), you must not: 
 
Deal in those Securities;  
 
cause or procure any other person to Deal in those Securities; and 
 
give Inside Information to any other person (including by giving hints or 
tips).  This includes if you know or should know that the person would, or 
would be likely to use the information to Deal in those Securities (or procure 
another person to Deal in those Securities).   
This prohibition applies at all times including to Excluded Dealings, during Trading 
Windows, and even where a Dealing clearance or a Trading Window exemption 
has been given. It overrides all other provisions of this policy. Before Dealing, you 
For personal use only
Group Securities Trading Policy 
 
2 | Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
Effective: 09 October 2019 
 
should consider carefully whether you are aware of any Inside Information and if 
you are in doubt you must not Deal. 
2. (Inappropriate Dealings) You must not Deal in Securities if the proposed Dealing 
could be perceived as you taking advantage of your position for personal gain.  
 
3. (Limited Hedging) You must not Hedge your exposure to unvested Group 
Securities issued or acquired under any Group equity plan, or where a holding 
lock or Dealing restriction applies under the terms of the plan. 
 
Additional 
requirements that 
apply to Specified 
Persons and their 
Associates  
 
 
4. (Permitted Dealings) Specified Persons and their Associates may only Deal in 
Group Securities if the Dealing: 
 
occurs through CommSec (the stockbroking firm operated by the Group) or 
another broker approved by Group Compliance; and 
 
is not otherwise prohibited under this policy; and 
 
is either: 
- 
an Excluded Dealing; 
- 
given clearance (where required under both this and BU/SU specific 
policies and procedures) and is placed during a Trading Window before 
the clearance expires; or 
- 
given a Trading Window exemption and is placed before the exemption 
expires.   
5. (Prohibited Dealings) Specified Persons and their Associates must not: 
 
use or Deal in Group Securities for margin lending or other secured financing 
arrangements, as a forced sale may lead to the breach of this policy; 
 
hold Group Securities for less than a thirty day period, calculated on a last 
in, first out basis, which prohibits short term Dealing (e.g. forward 
contracts); 
 
enter into contracts for difference or use any instruments or enter any 
arrangements for short selling or stock lending of Group Securities, other 
than Excluded Dealings. This includes the practice of attempting to profit 
from an anticipated drop or rise in the price of Group Securities. 
6. (Responsibility for compliance by Associates)  Specified Persons must ensure 
their Associates are aware of the requirements of this policy and they must take 
reasonable steps to ensure their Associates comply with those requirements. 
Additional 
requirements that 
apply to CBA Board 
directors, the CEO, 
Group Executives, 
the Company 
Secretary and their 
Associates 
 
7. (Prohibited Dealings) CBA Board directors, the CEO, Group Executives, the 
Company Secretary and their Associates must not:  
 
Deal in any Group Security that is listed or traded on a regulated European 
market; or  
 
Deal in any other Security that has a price or value which depends on, or has 
an effect on, the price or value of a Group Security that is listed or traded on 
a regulated European market.  
This is required under European Market Abuse Regulation No 596/2014 to meet 
obligations for Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibilities (PDMRs). 
8. (No Hedging) CBA Board directors, the CEO, Group Executives, Company 
Secretary and their Associates must not Hedge their exposure to vested Group 
Securities (this is in addition to requirement 3).

Clearances 
Specified Persons and their Associates must request clearance for a proposed 
Dealing in Group Securities from the relevant approver as  set out in Attachment A.

placed until market close on the last day of a Trading Window. Dealings involving

sell or maximum purchase price or a stop-loss instruction) that are not executed 
during the Trading Window are in breach of this policy.  
Trading Window 
exemptions 
Specified Persons and their Associates may apply for a Trading Window exemption 
to Deal in Group Securities outside a Trading Window in exceptional circumstances. 
Exceptional circumstances and the procedures to follow when applying for an 
exemption are set out in Attachment A.

ASIC guidance for retail investors
ASIC has published guidance on hybrid securities on its MoneySmart website which may be relevant to your 
consideration of PERLS XII. You can find this guidance by searching hybrid securities at www.moneysmart.gov.au. 
The guidance includes a series of questions you should ask before you invest in hybrid securities, as well as a short quiz 
to check your understanding of how hybrids work, their features and risks. 
Where can I learn more about investing in bank hybrid securities?
CBA has developed an interactive module on bank hybrid securities which may assist you to better understand 
bank hybrid securities, their features and risks. It explains the different ways you may invest in a bank, including by 
depositing money or investing in securities issued by a bank.
The module is available at www.commbank.com.au/about-us/shareholders/securities/bank-hybrid-securities-basics.html, 
and can be found by searching hybrid securities basics on www.commbank.com.au.  
Where can I obtain further information about CBA and PERLS XII?
CBA is a disclosing entity for the purposes of the Corporations Act and, as a result, is subject to regular reporting 
and disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act and the ASX Listing Rules. In addition, CBA must notify ASX 
immediately (subject to certain exceptions) if it becomes aware of information about CBA that a reasonable person 
would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of its securities including PERLS XII.
Copies of documents lodged with ASIC can be obtained from, or inspected at, an ASIC office. Certain of these 
documents can also be obtained from www.asx.com.au together with CBAs other ASX announcements.
In addition, the following information can be obtained from the Investor Centre at www.commbank.com.au/investors:
 
CBAs half-yearly and annual financial reports;

other general information provided to investors.

financial position and solvency of CBA. They are not deposit liabilities or protected accounts of CBA under the 
Banking Act.

Risks associated with PERLS XII specifically
PERLS XII are not 
deposit liabilities 
or protected 
accounts
Investments	in	PERLS	XII	are	an	investment	in	CBA	and	maybe	
affected	by	the	ongoing	performance,	financial	position	and	
solvency	of	CBA.	They	are	not	deposit	liabilities	or	protected	
accounts of CBA under the Banking Act.
Section	4.2.1
50
PERLS XII are 
subordinated and 
unsecured
PERLS	XII	are	subordinated	and	unsecured	liabilities.	In	a	winding	
up	of	CBA,	there	is	a	risk	that	you	may	lose	some	or	all	of	the	
money	you	invested	in	PERLS	XII.
Section	4.2.2	
50
Distributions may 
not be paid
Distributions	are	discretionary	and	subject	to	the	Distribution	
payment	conditions	being	satisfied.	Distributions	that	are	not	paid	
do	not	accrue	and	will	not	be	subsequently	paid.
Section	4.2.3	
50
PERLS XII may 
be Exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares
PERLS XII may be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares on the 
Mandatory	Exchange	Date	(subject	to	the	Maximum	Exchange	
Number and Mandatory Exchange Conditions) or on another date 
if	certain	events	occur.	This	includes	if	a	Capital	Trigger	Event,	Non-
Viability	Trigger	Event	or	Change	of	Control	Event	occurs.	There	
is	a	risk	that	on	Exchange	you	may	receive	a	number	of	Ordinary	
Shares	with	a	value	which	is	significantly	less	than	the	Face	Value,	
including as a result of the application of the Maximum Exchange 
Number and the market price for Ordinary Shares at the time.
Sections	4.2.4	 
and	4.2.5
51,
52
Ordinary 
Shares are a 
different type of 
investment to 
PERLS XII
Dividends	on	Ordinary	Shares	are	payable	at	the	absolute	
discretion	of	CBA	and	the	amount	of	each	dividend	is	discretionary	
(not	subject	to	a	formula).	In	a	winding	up	of	CBA,	claims	of	
holders of Ordinary Shares rank behind claims of holders of all 
other	securities	and	debts	of	CBA.	In	contrast,	Distributions	on	
PERLS	XII	are	payable	in	accordance	with	the	Terms	and	claims	of	
PERLS	XII	holders	rank	ahead	of	Holders	of	Ordinary	Shares.

following a 
Capital Trigger 
Event or  
Non-Viability 
Trigger Event may 
cause you to lose 
your investment
If	a	Capital	Trigger	Event	or	Non-Viability	Trigger	Event	occurs	
and Exchange fails to take effect for any reason and CBA has not 
otherwise	issued	the	Ordinary	Shares	required	to	be	issued	in	
respect	of	such	Exchange	within	5	Business	Days,	then	Holders	
rights	under	the	relevant	PERLS	XII	will	be	immediately	and

occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Capital 
Trigger	Event	or	Non-Viability	Trigger	Event.	Your	investment	in	
the	relevant	PERLS	XII	will	lose	all	of	its	value		the	Face	Value	
will	not	be	paid	and	you	will	not	receive	any	compensation.	This	
could	occur	if	CBA	was	prevented	from	issuing	Ordinary	Shares	
by	circumstances	outside	of	its	control,	for	example,	if	CBA	was	
prevented	by	an	applicable	law	or	order	of	any	court,	or	action	of	
any	government	authority,	from	issuing	Ordinary	Shares.

Information About CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes
16
The following is an overview of the key terms of PERLS XII. It is important that you read this Prospectus, the Terms, 
Deed Poll and the Constitution in full before deciding to invest in PERLS XII. If you have any questions, you should seek 
advice from your financial or other professional adviser.
The full Terms are contained in Appendix A. Rights and liabilities attaching to PERLS XII may also arise under the 
Corporations Act, the ASX Listing Rules and other applicable laws.
2.1 
Distributions on CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes
PERLS XII are scheduled to pay floating rate Distributions quarterly until all PERLS XII are Exchanged or Redeemed.
Further 
information
Page
2.1.1 
How are Distributions calculated on PERLS XII?
Distribution Rate
The Distribution Rate is calculated using the following formula:
Distribution Rate =  
(Market Rate + Margin) x (1  Tax Rate)
Where
Market Rate is the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (BBSW) 
administered by ASX Benchmarks Pty Limited (or any other 
person that takes on the administration of that rate) expressed as 
a percentage per annum for a term of 3months. The Market Rate 
is the primary benchmark interest rate for the Australian money 
market. It is the primary short-term rate used in the financial 
markets for the pricing and valuation of Australian dollar securities 
and as a lending reference rate. The Market Rate changes to 
reflect supply and demand within the cash and currency markets 
and it is possible for the Market Rate to become negative. 
The Market Rate for each Distribution Period is set on the first 
Business Day of the Distribution Period.
Margin is expected to be between 3.00% and 3.20% per annum 
and will be determined through the Bookbuild.
Tax Rate is the Australian corporate tax rate on the relevant 
Distribution Payment Date.
Distributions are expected to be fully franked.
The first Distribution is scheduled to be paid on 15March2020.
Distributions are discretionary and subject to the Distribution 
payment conditions being satisfied. Distributions that are not paid 
do not accrue and will not be subsequently paid. Non-payment of 
a Distribution will not be an event of default and CBA will have no 
liability to Holders in respect of the unpaid Distribution.
If CBA determines that BBSW has been affected by a Market 
Rate Disruption Event, CBA may select an Alternative Market 
Rate that it considers appropriate and make other related 
changes to the Terms (subject to APRAs prior written approval in 
certain circumstances). Approval is at the discretion of APRA and 
may or may not be given.
Broadly, a Market Rate Disruption Event occurs where BBSW 
is not published by 10:30am (or any such time as CBA considers 
appropriate), there is an obvious error in the rate, BBSW has 
been discontinued or ceases to be calculated or administered, 
or BBSW has ceased to be generally accepted in the Australian 
market for securities such as PERLS XII. CBA is required to act in 
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in selecting 
an Alternative Market Rate, and may consult with sources that it 
considers appropriate, but may otherwise exercise its discretion.

PERLS XII Capital 
Notes Clause2

Where an Alternative Market Rate applies, CBA retains a discretion 
to incorporate an adjustment (subject to APRAs written approval 
in certain circumstances), in order to reduce or eliminate, to the 
extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic 
prejudice or benefit to Holders as a result of the use of an 
Alternative Market Rate.
Further detail is set out in Clause 2.2 of the Terms.

This chart shows historical movements in the Market Rate. Past 
levels are not necessarily indicative of future levels.
It is possible for the Market Rate to become negative. Should 
this occur, the negative amount will be taken into account in 
calculating the Distribution Rate. For example, if the Market Rate 
is -1.00% per annum, the Margin is 3.00% per annum and the 
Australian corporate tax rate is 30%, then the Distribution Rate will 
be 1.40% per annum.
Calculation of 
Distributions
The Distribution payable on each PERLS XII for each Distribution 
Period is calculated using the following formula:
Distribution payable =
Distribution Rate x Face Value x Number of days in the 
Distribution Period / 365
For example, if the Face Value is A$100 (based on the Initial Face 
Value), the Market Rate is 0.84% per annum, the Margin is 3.00% 
per annum, the Australian corporate tax rate is 30% and the 
Distribution Period is 90days in length, the Distribution for the 
relevant Distribution Period would be calculated as follows:
3.84% x (1 - 30%) x A$100 x 90/365
= A$0.6628 per PERLS XII
This Distribution would be expected to be fully franked.
The above example is for illustrative purposes only and does not 
indicate, guarantee or forecast the actual Distribution Rate for any 
Distribution Period. The actual Distribution payable may be higher 
or lower than this example.
The Face Value used in this example is the Initial Face Value but 
the Face Value could be reduced if a Capital Trigger Event or 
Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs.

Information about the Distribution Rate can also be obtained 
from ASX at www.asx.com.au and from the Investor Centre at

Franking credits
Distributions are expected to be fully franked.
If any Distribution is not fully franked for any reason, then that 
Distribution will be grossed up according to the formula in 
Clause2.4 of the Terms.
The ability for Holders to use franking credits, either as an offset 
to a tax liability or by claiming a refund, will depend on that Holders 
particular tax circumstance and any changes in Australian tax law.

Holders;
 
payment not resulting in a breach of CBAs capital requirements 
as they are applied to the CBA Level1 Group or the CBA Level2

due to a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-Viability Trigger Event.
Distributions that are not paid do not accrue and will not be 
subsequently paid. Non-payment of a Distribution on the relevant

Distribution. However, from that Distribution Payment Date and 
until a Distribution is paid in full on a subsequent Distribution 
Payment Date (or all PERLS XII are Exchanged, Redeemed or

Early Redemption 
by CBA  for 
taxation reasons
A tax reason arises when:
 
as a result of a change in, or amendment to, the laws of 
Australia, or any change in their application or official or judicial 
interpretation or administration (including any announcement 
of a prospective change or amendment which has been or will 
be introduced), other than a change or amendment expected 
by CBA as at the Issue Date, there is a material risk that CBA 
would not be able to frank Distributions; or
 
CBA receives an opinion from reputable legal counsel or other 
tax adviser that there is a material risk that as a result of a 
change in, or amendment to, the laws of Australia, or any 
change in their application or official or judicial interpretation 
or administration (including any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or will be 
introduced), other than a change or amendment expected by 
CBA as at the Issue Date, CBA would be required to pay an 
increased amount under Clause9.6 of the Terms, or would be

Mandatory Exchange Conditions are not satisfied on that date, 
the first Distribution Payment Date after that date on which the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied.

Exchange on 
the Mandatory 
Exchange Date
On the Mandatory Exchange Date (subject to the Maximum 
Exchange Number and Mandatory Exchange Conditions), you will 
receive for each of your PERLS XII a variable number of Ordinary 
Shares with a value equal to A$101.01 (based on the Initial Face 
Value and the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during the period of 
20Business Days before the Mandatory Exchange Date with the 
benefit of a 1%discount). The value of Ordinary Shares you receive 
could be less than this amount if the Face Value has previously 
been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event).
To realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you can sell them on 
ASX at the prevailing market price.

Exchange 
Number
CBA will issue to the Holder the Exchange Number of Ordinary 
Shares for each PERLS XII held by a Holder.
The Exchange Number is calculated according to the following 
formula, subject to the Exchange Number being no greater than 
the Maximum Exchange Number:
Face Value
0.99 x VWAP
Based on a Face Value of A$100 (the Initial Face Value) and with 
the benefit of the 1%discount, this means that you will receive a 
variable number of Ordinary Shares with a value equal to A$101.01. 
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less than this 
amount if the Face Value has previously been reduced (following a 
previous Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event).

Maximum 
Exchange 
Number
The number of Ordinary Shares that you will receive will not be 
greater than the Maximum Exchange Number which is calculated 
according to the following formula:
Face Value
Relevant Percentage x Issue Date VWAP
The Relevant Percentage is 0.50 if Exchange is occurring on a 
Mandatory Exchange Date.
The Issue Date VWAP is the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during 
the period of 20Business Days immediately preceding 
(but not including) the Issue Date for PERLS XII.
For example, if the Face Value is A$100 (based on the Initial Face 
Value) and the Issue Date VWAP is A$81, the Maximum Exchange 
Number would be calculated as follows:
A$100
(0.50 x A$81) 
= 2.4691 Ordinary Shares per PERLS XII
The Maximum Exchange Number may limit you to receiving 
a number of Ordinary Shares with a value (measured over the 
period prior to Exchange) which is significantly less than the 
Face Value on Exchange. To provide some protection for Holders 
against this occurring, Exchange on a Mandatory Exchange Date 
will not occur unless the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are 
satisfied.
However, depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth less than the 
Face Value, and may suffer loss as a consequence.
The Maximum Exchange Number will reduce if the Face Value 
has previously been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event).

VWAP
VWAP means the average of the daily volume weighted average 
prices of Ordinary Shares traded on ASX and Chi-X during the 
relevant period of 20Business Days, subject to adjustments.
It is intended to calculate a fair price of Ordinary Shares which is 
used to calculate the Exchange Number and Maximum Exchange 
Number.

Mandatory 
Exchange 
Conditions
Exchange will not occur unless all the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions are satisfied. If Exchange does not occur, you will 
continue to hold your PERLS XII until the first Distribution 
Payment Date after that date on which all the Mandatory 
Exchange Conditions are satisfied, at which time Exchange 
will occur.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions are:
 
First Mandatory Exchange Condition: the VWAP of Ordinary 
Shares on the 25thBusiness Day before (but not including) a 
potential Mandatory Exchange Date is greater than 56% of the 
Issue Date VWAP;
 
Second Mandatory Exchange Condition: the VWAP of 
Ordinary Shares during the period of 20Business Days before 
(but not including) a potential Mandatory Exchange Date is 
greater than 50.51% of the Issue Date VWAP; and
 
Third Mandatory Exchange Condition: Ordinary Shares 
are listed or admitted to trading on ASX as at the Mandatory 
Exchange Date.
The First and Second Mandatory Exchange Conditions are intended 
to provide some protection for Holders against Exchange occurring 
when the price of Ordinary Shares has fallen to such a level that 
you would only receive the Maximum Exchange Number.
CBA has had regard to market precedents and the cap on 
the number of Ordinary Shares permitted to be issued under 
applicable APRA prudential standards and ratings guidance in 
determining the percentages specified in the First and Second 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions.
The Third Mandatory Exchange Condition is intended to provide 
protection to Holders to enable them to sell the Ordinary Shares 
they receive on ASX if they wish to do so.
The following diagram illustrates the timeframes that are relevant 
for the Mandatory Exchange Conditions, using the date of 
20April2029 as a potential Mandatory Exchange Date. These

If you do not wish to receive Ordinary Shares, you can notify CBA 
of this at any time prior to the Exchange Date.
If Exchange occurs and you have notified CBA that you do not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares, or if you are an Ineligible Holder1, 
then CBA will issue the relevant number of Ordinary Shares to a 
Nominee who will hold the Ordinary Shares on trust for sale for 
your benefit2. At the first opportunity, the Nominee will arrange 
for the sale of the Ordinary Shares on your behalf and pay the 
proceeds less selling costs to you. No guarantee is given in relation 
to the timing or price at which any sale will occur.

Automatic early 
Exchange  
general
CBA must Exchange all or some PERLS XII or a percentage of the 
Face Value of each PERLS XII in the following circumstances:
 
if a Capital Trigger Event occurs; or
 
if a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply.
On the Exchange Date (subject to the Maximum Exchange 
Number), you will receive for each of your PERLS XII a variable 
number of Ordinary Shares with a value equal to A$101.01 (based 
on the Initial Face Value of A$100 and the VWAP of Ordinary 
Shares with the benefit of a 1%discount). The VWAP is based on 
the period of 5Business Days before the Exchange Date.
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less than this 
amount if only a percentage of the Face Value is being Exchanged, 
if the Face Value has previously been reduced (following a 
previous Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event) or if 
the Maximum Exchange Number applies.
As a result of the application of the Maximum Exchange Number 
and depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth significantly 
less than A$101.01 per PERLS XII (based on an Initial Face Value of 
A$100), and may suffer a loss as a consequence.
To realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you can sell them on 
ASX at the prevailing market price.

Capital Trigger 
Event
A Capital Trigger Event occurs when:
 
CBA determines; or
 
APRA notifies CBA in writing that it believes,
that either or both the CBA Level1 Common Equity Tier1 (CET1) 
Capital Ratio or CBA Level2 CET1 Capital Ratio is equal to or less 
than 5.125%.
The CET1 Capital Ratio is the ratio of CBAs CET1 Capital to its 
risk-weighted assets, where CET1 Capital is the strongest form of 
capital held by CBA. CBAs Level2 CET1 Capital Ratio was 10.7% 
as at 30June2019, which equates to a surplus of approximately 
A$23.2 billion above the Capital Trigger Event level of 5.125%.  
CBAs Level1 CET1 Capital Ratio was 11.2% as at 30June2019, 
which equates to a surplus of approximately A$25.7 billion above 
the Capital Trigger Event level of 5.125%.
If a Capital Trigger Event occurs, CBA must immediately Exchange 
such number of PERLS XII (or a percentage of the Face Value of 
each PERLS XII) as is sufficient to return the relevant CET1 Capital 
Ratio to above 5.125%.

necessary because, without it, CBA would become non-viable.
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, CBA must immediately 
Exchange such number of PERLS XII (or a percentage of the 
Face Value of each PERLS XII) as specified by APRA or necessary

How does 
Exchange 
work upon the 
occurrence of a 
Capital Trigger 
Event or  
Non-Viability 
Trigger Event?
Upon the occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, CBA must immediately Exchange all or some PERLS 
XII (or a percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII). The 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply and the Terms 
provide that Exchange occurs automatically without the need for 
any further act or step by CBA and that CBA will recognise Holders 
as having been issued Ordinary Shares.
Any ASX trades in PERLS XII that have not settled on the date 
a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs 
will continue to settle in accordance with the normal ASX T+2 
settlement, although the seller will be treated as having delivered, 
and the buyer will be treated as having acquired, the number of 
Ordinary Shares into which PERLS XII have been Exchanged  
as a result of the occurrence of the Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event.
If Exchange fails to take effect for any reason and CBA has not 
otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in 
respect of such Exchange within 5Business Days, then Holders 
rights under the relevant PERLS XII will be immediately and 
irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have 
occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event. Your investment in 
the relevant PERLS XII will lose all of its value and you will not 
receive any compensation. This could occur if CBA is prevented 
from issuing Ordinary Shares by circumstances outside its control, 
for example, if CBA is prevented by a specified law or order of 
any court, or action of any government authority, from issuing 
Ordinary Shares.

Exchange 
Number
CBA will issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares for  
each PERLS XII held by a Holder.
The Exchange Number is calculated according to the same 
formula that applies to Exchange on the Mandatory Exchange 
Date (see Section 2.3 Mandatory Exchange), but with the VWAP 
based on the period of 5Business Days before the Exchange Date, 
and is subject to the Exchange Number being no greater than the 
Maximum Exchange Number.
The amount used as the Face Value in this calculation will 
only be the affected percentage of the Face Value required to 
be Exchanged and, if the full Face Value is not required to be 
Exchanged, you will continue to hold your PERLS XII with a 
reduced Face Value.

Maximum 
Exchange 
Number
The number of Ordinary Shares that you will receive will not be 
greater than the Maximum Exchange Number which is calculated 
according to the following formula:
Face Value
Relevant Percentage x Issue Date VWAP
The Relevant Percentage is 0.20 if a Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred.
The Issue Date VWAP is the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during 
the period of 20Business Days immediately preceding 
(but not including) the Issue Date for PERLS XII.
For example, if the Face Value is A$100 (based on the Initial Face 
Value) and the Issue Date VWAP is A$81, the Maximum Exchange 
Number would be calculated as follows:
A$100
(0.20 x A$81) 
= 6.1728 Ordinary Shares per PERLS XII
The Maximum Exchange Number may limit you to receiving a 
number of Ordinary Shares with a value which is significantly less 
than the Face Value.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply if a Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred.
As a result of the application of the Maximum Exchange Number 
and depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth significantly 
less than A$101.01 per PERLS XII (based on the Initial Face Value of 
A$100), and may suffer loss as a consequence.
The Maximum Exchange Number will reduce if the Face Value 
has previously been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event).

A Change of Control Event occurs when:
 
a takeover bid for Ordinary Shares is made and certain

The Issue Date VWAP is the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during 
the period of 20Business Days immediately preceding (but not 
including) the Issue Date for PERLS XII.
The Maximum Exchange Number may limit you to receiving 
a number of Ordinary Shares with a value (measured over the

Conditions are satisfied as modified by Clause4.7(c) of the Terms.
However, depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth less than the

Ranking in a

Senior Ranking Obligations are all deposits and other liabilities, 
securities and other obligations of CBA (other than Equal Ranking 
Securities or Junior Ranking Securities). In a winding up of CBA, 
your claim will rank after the claims of holders of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, including creditors preferred by law and secured 
creditors.
Your claim will rank equally with claims of other Holders and 
holders of Equal Ranking Securities. This means your PERLS XII 
rank equivalently to a preference share.
Your claim will rank ahead of claims of holders of Junior Ranking 
Securities (being holders of Ordinary Shares).
On Exchange, Holders will become holders of Ordinary Shares and 
rank equally with other holders of Ordinary Shares and could lose 
all of their investment on a winding up of CBA.

Substitution
CBA may, in connection with a NOHC Event, without the consent 
of Holders but subject to APRA approval1, substitute a NOHC 
as the debtor under PERLS XII and as the issuer of ordinary 
shares on Exchange by giving notice to the Holders and ASX 
(Full Successor). Alternatively, CBA may substitute a NOHC 
only as the issuer of ordinary shares (Partial Successor). 
Any substitution is subject to the NOHC expressly assuming 
the relevant obligations of CBA under the Terms (including, 
in the instance of a Full Successor, the restrictions on paying 
Distributions and dividends on Ordinary Shares (with appropriate 
modifications)) and satisfying certain other conditions, including 
the quotation of the ordinary shares of the NOHC on a securities 
exchange. The substitution of a NOHC does not allow CBA to 
elect to Exchange PERLS XII nor does it give you a right to request

the agreement of CBA to observe its obligations as set out  
in the Terms;

Business strategy of CBA 
CBAs	purpose	is	to	improve	the	financial	wellbeing	of	
its	customers	and	communities.	CBAs	purpose	provides	
clear	direction	to	its	people	and	guides	its	strategy.	
CBAs	strategy	is	to	become	a	simpler,	better	bank	that	
delivers	balanced	and	sustainable	outcomes	for	its	
customers,	community,	its	people	and	shareholders.	CBA	
has	set	three	execution	priorities:	simplify	the	business;	
lead	in	retail	and	commercial	banking;	and	best	in	digital.	
CBA	believes	these	priorities	best	leverage	its	competitive	
advantages	and	positions	it	for	success.
To	deliver	on	the	strategy,	CBA	is	investing	in	four	
critical	capabilities:	operational	risk	and	compliance;	cost	
reduction;	data	and	analytics;	and	innovation.	These	
capabilities	address	CBAs	operating	context	and	best	
support	performance	into	the	future.	
Most	importantly,	the	goal	of	the	strategy	is	to	deliver	
balanced	and	sustainable	outcomes	for	CBAs	stakeholders.	
Further details and examples of strategic initiatives  
can be found in the 2019Annual Report, available 
from the Investor Centre at www.commbank.com.au/
annual-reports.
3.4 
 Financial services industry 
regulatory environment 
There	is	currently	an	environment	of	heightened	political	
scrutiny	on	the	Australian	financial	services	industry,	and	
CBA	has	been	involved	in	a	number	of	regulatory,	legal	
and	industry	reviews.	This	and	the	extensive	regulation	
CBA	is	subject	to	poses	regulatory	and	reputational	
challenges	for	CBA.	
CBA	aims	to	earn	the	trust	of	its	customers,	regulators	
and	the	community,	and	is	seeking	to	ensure	it	does	
not	make	mistakes	which	might	undermine	trust	in	the	
future.	
The	risks	to	CBAs	business	from	regulatory	matters,	
litigation	and	reputational	damage	are	outlined	in	
Sections	4.3.1	CBA	is	subject	to	extensive	regulation	
and	operates	in	an	environment	of	political	scrutiny,	
which	could	adversely	impact	its	operations	and	financial	
condition	and	4.3.2	CBA	may	be	adversely	affected	by	
damage	to	its	reputation	and	4.3.11	CBAs	business	could	
be	negatively	impacted	by	substantial	legal	liability	or	
regulatory	action.Examples	of	some	current	matters	are	
described	below.
(i)	 APRA	Prudential	Inquiry	into	CBA
The	Panel	appointed	by	APRA	to	conduct	the	
independent	prudential	inquiry	into	CBA	published	its	
final	report	on	1May2018	(APRA Report).	The	APRA	
Report	makes	a	number	of	findings	regarding	the	
complex	interplay	of	organisational	and	cultural	factors	
within	the	CBA	Group	and	the	need	for	enhanced	
management	of	non-financial	risks.	In	response	to	
the	APRA	Report,	the	CBA	Group	has	acknowledged	
that	it	will	implement	all	of	the	recommendations	
and	has	agreed	to	adjust	its	minimum	operational	
risk	capital	requirements	by	an	additional	A$1billion	
(risk-weighted	assets	A$12.5billion),	until	such	time	
as	the	recommendations	are	implemented	to	APRAs	
satisfaction.
CBA	has	entered	into	an	Enforceable	Undertaking	
under	which	CBAs	remedial	action	(Remedial 
Action Plan)	in	response	to	the	APRA	Report	would	
be	agreed	and	regularly	monitored	by	APRA.	The	
Remedial	Action	Plan	provides	a	detailed	program	
of	change	outlining	how	CBA	will	improve	the	
way	it	runs	its	business,	manages	risk	and	works	
with	regulators.	The	Remedial	Action	Plan	also	
provides	a	comprehensive	assurance	framework,	
with	Promontory	Australasia	(Sydney)	Pty	Ltd	
(Promontory)	having	been	appointed	as	the	
independent	reviewer	and	who	is	required	to	report	to	
APRA	on	the	CBA	Groups	progress	against	committed	
milestones	every	3	months.	
As	at	30June2019,	Promontory	has	submitted	
four	reports	which	have	been	publicly	released	
by	CBA.	Promontory	has	noted	that	the	Remedial	
Action	Plan	program	of	work	remains	on	track	and	
CBAs	commitment	to	implementing	the	APRAs	
recommendations	in	a	timely	and	comprehensive	
way	continued	to	be	strong	with	all	156	milestones	on	
schedule	to	be	delivered	by	the	due	date.

Information About CBA (continued)
Section 3
As	at	30June2019,	CBA	submitted	a	total	of	
75	milestones	to	Promontory	for	assessment.
The	CBA	Group	has	provided	for	costs	associated	with	
the	implementation	of	the	Remedial	Action	Plan.
(ii)	AUSTRAC	and	related	proceedings
In	October	2017,	CBA	was	served	with	a	shareholder	
class	action	proceeding	filed	in	the	Federal	Court	
of	Australia	alleging	breaches	of	CBAs	continuous	
disclosure	obligations	and	misleading	and	
deceptive	conduct	in	relation	to	the	subject	matter	
of	the	civil	penalty	proceedings	brought	by	the	
Australian	Transaction	Reports	and	Analysis	Centre	
(AUSTRAC).	The	AUSTRAC	proceedings	concerned	
contraventions	of	the	Anti-Money	Laundering	and	
Counter	Terrorism	Financing	Act	2006	(Cth)	(AML/
CTF Act).	The	resolution	of	the	proceedings	was	
approved	by	the	Federal	Court	on	20June2018	with	
CBA	paying	a	penalty	of	A$700million	and	legal	costs.	
In	the	shareholder	class	action,	it	is	alleged	that	CBA	
shareholders	who	acquired	an	interest	in	CBA	shares	
between	1	July	2015	and	3	August	2017	suffered	loss	
caused	by	the	alleged	conduct.
On	29June2018,	a	similar	second	shareholder	class	
action	in	relation	to	the	matter	of	the	AUSTRAC	
proceedings	was	served	on	CBA	on	behalf	of	certain	
CBA	shareholders	who	acquired	an	interest	in	CBA	
shares	between	16	June	2014	and	3	August	2017.	On	
10July2019,	court	orders	were	made	confirming	the	
two	class	action	proceedings	would	continue	and	
would	be	case	managed	together	and	proceed	by	way	
of	one	harmonised	statement	of	claim.
It	is	currently	not	possible	to	determine	the	ultimate	
impact	of	these	claims,	if	any,	on	the	CBA	Group.	The	
CBA	Group	denies	the	allegations	and	continues	to	
defend	both	claims.	The	CBA	Group	has	provided	for	
legal	costs	expected	to	be	incurred	in	the	defence	of	
the	claims.	
(iii)	The	Royal	Commission
The	Royal	Commission	was	established	on	
14	December	2017	and	was	authorised	to	inquire	into	
misconduct	by	financial	service	entities	(including	
CBA).	Seven	rounds	of	hearings	into	misconduct	
in	the	banking	and	financial	services	industry	were	
held	throughout	2018,	covering	a	variety	of	topics	
including	consumers	and	business	lending,	financial	
advice,	superannuation,	insurance	and	policy	round.	
The	Royal	Commissions	final	report	was	delivered	on	
1February2019.	The	final	report	included	76	policy	
recommendations	to	the	Australian	Government	and	
findings	in	relation	to	the	case	studies	investigated	
during	hearings,	with	a	number	of	referrals	being	
made	to	regulators	for	misconduct	by	financial	
institutions,	which	is	expected	to	result	in	heightened	
levels	of	enforcement	action	across	the	industry.
The	76	recommendations	covered	many	of	CBAs	
business	areas	and	also	canvassed	the	role	of	
the	regulators	and	the	approach	to	be	taken	to	
customer	focus,	culture	and	remuneration.	The	
recommendations	regarding	the	role	of	regulators	
and	their	approach	to	enforcement	may	increase	
enforcement	activity,	costs	and	reputational	impact	
for	financial	institutions.	CBA	released	a	statement	
to	the	ASX	on	8March2019	welcoming	the	final	
report	and	committing	to	actions	to	deliver	the	
recommendations.	The	Government	has	accepted	 
75	of	the	76	recommendations.
(iv)	Other	industry-wide	regulatory	reforms	and	political	
developments
Other	industry-wide	regulatory	reforms	and	political	
developments	include	the	comprehensive	credit	
reporting	and	open	banking	regimes,	the	Banking	
Executive	Accountability	Regime	which	took	effect	
from	1July2018,	and	the	new	Banking	Code	of	Practice	
approved	by	ASIC	which	took	effect	from	1July2019.
Further	detail	on	the	matters	described	in	this	 
Section	3.4	and	other	updates	on	legal,	regulatory	and	
industry	levels	are	included	in	the	2019Annual	Report	
and	Note	7.1	to	the	Financial	Statements	in	the	Profit

3.8.1 Capital adequacy
3.8.1.1 Capital generally
CBA	is	an	ADI	regulated	by	APRA	and	other	regulatory	
bodies.	APRA	generally	follows	the	principles	for	banking	
supervision	developed	by	the	Basel	Committee	on	
Banking	Supervision	(BCBS).
Under	the	principles	known	as	Basel	I,	Basel	II	and	
Basel	III,	an	ADI	is	currently	required	to	hold	a	certain	
level	of	regulatory	capital	against	its	risk-weighted	assets	
(RWA)	in	order	for	such	capital	to	absorb	losses	which	
an	ADI	may	incur	from	time	to	time,	and	therefore	protect	
depositors	from	realising	such	losses.
CET1	Capital	comprises	ordinary	share	capital,	retained	
earnings	and	certain	other	items	recognised	as	capital,	
less	prescribed	deductions.	The	ratio	of	such	capital	to	
RWA	is	called	the	CET1	Capital	Ratio.
Tier	1	Capital	comprises	CET1	Capital	plus	certain	
equity-like	securities	(such	as	PERLS	XII).	The	ratio	of	
such	capital	to	RWA	is	called	the	Tier	1	Capital	ratio.
Tier	2	Capital	comprises	certain	securities	having	features	
eligible	to	be	recognised	as	Tier	2	Capital.
The	strongest	and	most	loss	absorbent	form	of	capital	
is	CET1	Capital,	followed	by	other	Tier	1	Capital	and	then	
Tier	2	Capital.
The	sum	of	Tier	1	Capital	and	Tier	2	Capital	is	called	Total	
Capital.	The	ratio	of	Total	Capital	to	RWA	is	called	the	
Total	Capital	ratio.
Generally,	higher	capital	ratios	indicate	an	ADIs	financial	
strength	which	is	critical	to	the	ADIs	ability	to	refinance	
its	debt,	including	Tier	1	securities	such	as	PERLS	XII	in	
the	future.

Information About CBA (continued)
Section 3
Under	Basel	III,	an	ADI	is	required	to	have	a	minimum	
CET1	Capital	Ratio	of	4.5%	which	applies	to	both	the	
ADIs	Level	1	Group	and	Level	2	Group.	APRA	may	also	
determine	that	an	Australian	bank	is	required	to	hold	an	
additional	amount	of	capital	above	the	4.5%	minimum	
requirement,	and	the	total	of	the	4.5%	minimum	
requirement	and	any	additional	amount	required	is	called	
the	prudential	capital	requirement	(PCR).	CBA	has	held	
capital	at	levels	above	these	minimums	and	intends	to	
hold	capital	above	these	minimums	in	the	future.
An	ADI	is	required	to	maintain	a	capital	conservation	
buffer	(CCB)	in	the	form	of	CET1	Capital	equal	to	2.5%	
of	RWA,	unless	APRA	determines	otherwise.	
For	domestic	systemically	important	banks	(D-SIB),	such	
as	CBA,	APRA	currently	requires	a	1%	D-SIB	buffer,	raising	
the	CCB	to	at	least	3.5%.	This	makes	the	total	CET1	Capital	
requirement	for	a	D-SIB	equal	to	a	minimum	of	8%.	
APRA	also	has	the	discretion	to	apply	an	additional	
countercyclical	capital	buffer	to	all	banks	with	an	
indicative	range	of	between	0%	and	2.5%	of	CET1	Capital.	
If	applicable,	this	forms	part	of	the	CCB.	APRA	has	
currently	set	the	countercyclical	capital	buffer	applicable	
to	Australian	exposures	at	0%.
References	to	the	minimum	total	CET1	Capital	
requirement	applicable	under	APRAs	prudential	
standards	are	to	general	minimums	applying	under	
the	APRA	prudential	standards,	rather	than	specific	
minimums	applying	to	CBA.
In	addition,	the	Leverage	Ratio	will	act	as	a	supplementary	
measure	to	the	other	capital	requirements	and	is	defined	
as	an	ADIs	Tier	1	Capital	divided	by	that	ADIs	total	
exposures	(on	and	off	balance	sheet	exposures).

3.8.1.2 Capital Trigger Event
Under	Basel	III,	Tier	1	securities	(such	as	PERLS	XII)	must	include	a	Capital	Trigger	Event.
A	Capital	Trigger	Event	may	occur	if	either	or	both	the	CBA	Level	1	CET1	Capital	Ratio	or	CBA	Level	2	CET1	Capital	Ratio	
as	calculated	under	APRAs	approach	is	equal	to	or	less	than	5.125%	(see	Section	4.2.5	A	Capital	Trigger	Event	or	 
Non-Viability	Trigger	Event	may	occur).	CBA	has	held	CET1	Capital	at	levels	above	5.125%	and	intends	to	hold	capital	
above	this	level	in	the	future.

Includes	the	CCB.
CBAs	Level	1	CET1	Capital	Ratio	was	11.2%	as	
at	30June2019,	which	equates	to	a	surplus	of	
approximately	A$13.6billion	above	the	minimum	CET1	
Capital	requirement.
As	outlined	above,	discretionary	payments	(such	as	
Distributions	on	PERLS	XII)	may	not	be	paid	if	an	ADIs	
CET1	Capital	Ratio	falls	into	the	CCB.	Distributions	that	are	
not	paid	do	not	accrue	and	will	not	be	subsequently	paid.	
3.8.1.4 Leverage Ratio
The	Leverage	Ratio	represents	the	amount	of	Tier	1	
Capital	the	CBA	Level	2	Group	holds	against	its	exposures.	
This	is	a	supplementary	measure	to	the	other	capital	
requirements.	Such	capital	absorbs	losses	which	CBA	
may	incur	from	time	to	time	and	protects	depositors	from	
realising	such	losses.	Generally,	a	higher	leverage	ratio	
indicates	CBAs	financial	strength	which	is	critical	to	CBAs	
ability	to	refinance	its	debt,	including	PERLS	XII	in	the	
future.
As	at	30June2019,	CBAs	Leverage	Ratio	was	5.6%.	This	
means	that,	for	every	A$1	of	exposures	it	had,	it	held	
A$0.056	of	capital	in	the	form	of	Tier	1	Capital.
3.8.1.5 Regulatory developments 
APRA	has	implemented	a	number	of	actions	in	response	
to	the	Financial	System	Inquiry	(FSI)	Final	Report	of	
December	2014,	including	the	reports	recommendation	
that	Australian	ADIs	be	required	to	operate	with	
unquestionably	strong	capital	ratios.
In	July	2017,	APRA	released	an	information	paper	
Strengthening	banking	system	resilience		establishing	
unquestionably	strong	capital	ratios	in	relation	to	
establishing	the	quantum	of	capital	required	for	the	
Australian	banking	sector	to	have	capital	ratios	that	are	
unquestionably	strong.	APRA	stated	in	the	paper	that	
in	order	to	meet	the	objective	of	having	unquestionably	
strong	capital	ratios,	Australias	major	banks	would	need	
to	operate	with	an	average	benchmark	ratio	of	CET1	
Capital	to	RWA	of	10.5%	or	more	by	1	January	2020.
Separately,	on	7	December	2017,	the	BCBS	finalised	the	
Basel	III	bank	capital	framework	Basel	III:	Finalising	
post-crisis	reforms	confirming	new	measures	designed	
to	address	deficiencies	in	the	international	regulatory	
capital	framework	following	the	global	financial	crisis,	
primarily	focused	on	addressing	excessive	variability	in	
RWA,	and	therefore	capital	requirements,	across	banks.
In	response,	on	14	February	2018,	APRA	released	a	
discussion	paper	titled	Discussion	Paper		Revisions	
to	the	capital	framework	for	authorised	deposit-taking	
institutions	(Capital Framework Discussion Paper) 
to	commence	its	consultation	on	revisions	to	the	capital	
framework.	The	Capital	Framework	Discussion	Paper	
outlines	the	main	components	of	the	revisions	APRA	
expects	to	make	to	the	risk-based	capital	requirements	
for	ADIs	using	the	advanced	and	standardised	approach	
to	credit,	market	and	operational	risk.	APRA	has	since	
released	draft	prudential	standards	on	the	standardised	
approach	to	measuring	credit	and	operational	risk.	
In	addition,	APRA	has	proposed	a	simpler	method	
for	calculating	capital	requirements	for	residential	
mortgages	measured	under	the	internal	ratings	based	
(IRB)	approach.	APRA	has	also	indicated	that	it	will	
consult	on	the	prudential	standards	affecting	the	
measurement	of	capital	(APS111)	in	2019.
Amongst	other	things,	the	Capital	Framework	Discussion	
Paper	seeks	to	address	systemic	concentration	of	ADI	
portfolios	in	residential	mortgages	and	the	proposals	
seek	to	target	higher-risk	residential	mortgage	lending,	
including	investment	and	interest	only	loans.
APRA	has	stated	that	it	expects	the	overall	impact	of	
the	proposals	in	the	Capital	Framework	Discussion	
Paper	to	be	a	net	increase	in	ADIs	RWA.	APRA	has	
noted	that	all	else	being	equal,	this	will	reduce	an	ADIs	
reported	capital	ratios,	even	though	there	is	no	change	
to	the	ADIs	underlying	risk	profile	or	to	the	quantum	
of	capital	required	to	achieve	capital	ratios	that	are	
unquestionably	strong.
In	August2018,	APRA	released	a	second	discussion	paper	
titled	Discussion	paper		Improving	the	transparency,	
comparability	and	flexibility	of	the	ADI	capital	framework	
(Transparency, Comparability and Flexibility 
Discussion Paper).	APRA	proposes	two	key	approaches	
for	achieving	comparability,	without	changing	the	
quantum	or	allocation	of	capital.

The	first	approach	is	similar	to	current	practices,	but	
would	result	in	two	APRA-endorsed	capital	ratios.	ADIs	
would	continue	to	determine	regulatory	capital	ratios	
using	APRAs	definitions	of	capital	and	RWA,	and	this	
ratio	would	be	compared	to	minimum	requirements.	
A	second	capital	ratio	would	also	be	calculated	and	
disclosed	in	accordance	with	a	prescribed	APRA	
methodology.	APRA	proposes	that	this	second	
ratio	is	a	disclosure-only	capital	ratio,	primarily	for	
international	comparison.	
 
The	second	approach	will	result	in	only	one	set	
of	APRA	regulatory	capital	ratios	that	are	more	
internationally	harmonised	than	the	current	
approach,	or	the	first	approach.	This	will	be	achieved	
by	removing	certain	aspects	of	APRAs	relative	
conservatisms	from	an	ADIs	capital	ratio	calculations	
and	lifting	minimum	regulatory	capital	ratio	
requirements	in	tandem.	This	may	be	achieved	via	a	
capital	overlay	at	each	tier	of	capital	(CET1,	Tier	1	and	
Total	Capital).	APRA	has	noted	that	adoption	of	this	
approach	would	need	to	consider	the	alteration	of	the	
loss	absorption	trigger	point	of	5.125%	for	Tier	1	Capital	
securities	(such	as	PERLS	XII).
The	outcome	of	these	discussion	papers,	and	the	
overall	review	of	the	capital	framework,	will	determine	
whether	APRA	may	recalibrate	the	benchmark	10.5%	
CET1	Capital	Ratio	applicable	to	major	banks.	However,	
APRAs	expectation	is	that	any	change	will	not	necessitate	
additional	capital	raisings	by	ADIs	nor	alter	the	risk	
sensitivity	of	capital	requirements.	APRAs	intention	is	that	
the	quantum	of	capital	required	to	be	held	by	ADIs	under	
the	revised	capital	framework	can	be	accommodated	
within	the	amount	of	capital	they	would	have	needed	to	
hold	to	meet	the	10.5%	benchmark	CET1	Capital	Ratio	by	
January2020.	
Revisions	to	APRAs	prudential	standards	will	be	subject	
to	consultation	before	becoming	effective	from	1	January	
2021	for	operational	risk	and	from	1	January	2022	for	all	
other	reforms.	This	implementation	timeframe	is	also	
subject	to	consultation.	
Consistent	with	CBAs	approach	to	capital	management,	
CBA	intends	to	maintain	unquestionably	strong	capital	
ratios	through	a	range	of	initiatives,	including	organic	
capital	generation,	a	focus	on	financial	strength	and	
announced	asset	sales	(see	Section	3.8.1.6	CBAs	
approach	to	capital	management	and	Section	3.2	
Businesses	of	CBA).
In	addition	to	the	revisions	to	the	capital	framework,	
APRA	is	implementing	other	capital	related	FSI	
recommendations,	including	a	framework	for	minimum	
loss-absorbing	and	recapitalisation	capacity	and	the	
introduction	of	a	minimum	Leverage	Ratio	requirement	
for	ADIs.	
On	14February2018,	APRA	released	a	discussion	paper	
titled	Discussion	Paper		Leverage	ratio	requirements	
for	authorised	deposit-taking	institutions	(Leverage	
Ratio	Discussion	Paper).	Following	consultation,	in	
November2018,	APRA	announced	that	it	would	set	a	
minimum	Leverage	Ratio	requirement	of	3.5%	for	IRB	
ADIs,	including	CBA,	which	will	apply	from	1	January2022.	
On	9July2019,	APRA	released	its	response	to	the	
submissions	for	the	November	2018	discussion	paper	
titled	Discussion	Paper		increasing	the	loss-absorbing	
capacity	(LAC)	of	ADIs	to	support	orderly	resolution,	
APRA	confirmed	that	the	Australian	LAC	regime	will	be	
established	under	the	existing	capital	framework.	For	
D-SIBs,	including	CBA,	APRA	will	require	an	increase	in	
the	Total	Capital	requirement	by	3%	of	RWA,	effective	
1	January	2024.	APRA	further	noted	that	its	long	term	
target	of	4%	to	5%	of	LAC	remains	unchanged	and	it	
will	consider	feasible	alternative	methods	for	raising	
the	additional	1%	to	2%	over	the	next	four	years,	in	
consultation	with	industry	and	other	stakeholders.	
The	Reserve	Bank	of	New	Zealand	is	undertaking	a	
comprehensive	review	of	the	capital	adequacy	framework	
applying	to	registered	banks	in	New	Zealand.	The	latest	
consultation	paper	titled	Capital	Review	Paper	4:	How	
much	capital	is	enough?	released	in	December2018	
includes	proposals	to	increase	New	Zealand	IRB	banks	
RWA	to	90%	of	standardised	RWA	and	to	increase	
the	minimum	Tier	1	capital	requirement	for	banks	
which	are	deemed	systemically	important	to	16%	of	
RWA	(currently	8.5%).	Consultation	on	the	proposals	
is	now	closed	with	final	policy	decisions	expected	in	
November2019.	If	implemented	as	proposed,	these	
reforms	may	result	in	an	increase	in	CBAs	investment	
in	ASB.	However,	the	potential	capital	increase	is	not	
expected	to	impact	reported	CET1	Capital	Ratios	for	the	
CBA	Group	and	is	manageable	at	the	CBA	Parent	Bank	
level.	Sufficient	capacity	exists	under	APRAs	new	reduced	
limits	for	ADIs	exposures	to	related	entities,	including	for	
the	additional	capital	requirement	proposed	by	the	RBNZ.

3.8.1.6 CBAs approach to capital management
CBA	conservatively	but	proactively	manages	its	capital	
position	to	avoid	breaching	the	minimum	capital	
requirements	and	to	ensure	it	has	sufficient	capital	to	
manage	future	growth.	The	Board	and	management	are	
responsible	for	the	setting	of	internal	capital	minimums	
and	targets	to	ensure	that	CBAs	capital	is	prudently	above	
APRAs	minimum	capital	requirements.	
CBA	also	conducts	internal	assessments	of	the	
appropriate	level	of	capital	to	hold,	and	regularly	
stress-tests	various	scenarios	to	ensure	that	it	holds	
sufficient	capital	to	withstand	such	stresses.	It	takes	into	
consideration	the	level	of	capital	held	by	peer	banks,	both	
domestic	and	global.
CBA	issues	securities	such	as	PERLS	XII	to	satisfy	its	
Tier1	Capital	requirements	and	provide	flexibility	for

3.8.2 Funding and liquidity
3.8.2.1 Funding
CBA	raises	customer	deposits	as	well	as	long-term	and	
short-term	wholesale	debt	to	fund	its	business	activities,	
including	lending.	Customer	deposits	include	transaction,	
savings	and	investment	deposits	raised	from	retail,	
business	and	institutional	clients,	predominantly	in	
Australia.	Long-term	and	short-term	wholesale	debt	are	
raised	both	in	Australia	and	overseas.	CBA	conservatively	
but	proactively	manages	the	amount,	tenor	and	mix	of	its	
funding	to	ensure	it	has	sufficient	funding	for	its	current	
business	activities	and	to	manage	future	growth.
It	also	manages	its	wholesale	debt	maturities	to	ensure	
that	it	is	able	to	repay	or	refinance	its	liabilities	when	they	
fall	due.
Under	APRAs	liquidity	prudential	standard,	CBA	is	
required	to	comply	with	a	Net	Stable	Funding	Ratio	
(NSFR)	requirement	to	have	sufficient	stable	funding	
held	against	core	assets.	APRA	prescribed	factors	are	
used	to	determine	the	stable	funding	requirement	of	
assets	and	the	stability	of	funding.	Under	APRAs	liquidity	
prudential	standard,	CBA	must	maintain	an	NSFR	of	at	
least	100%.	
As	at	30June2019,	CBAs	NSFR	was	112%.	This	means	
that,	for	every	A$1	of	core	assets,	it	held	A$1.12	of	stable	
funding.

3.8.2.2 Liquidity
CBA	ensures	that	it	has	sufficient	cash,	liquid	assets	
(marketable	securities	and	repo-eligible	securities)	to	
ensure	that	it	is	able	to	repay	its	short	term	liabilities,	
including	repaying	deposits,	when	they	fall	due.
Under	APRAs	liquidity	prudential	standard,	CBA	is	
required	to	comply	with	a	Liquidity	Coverage	Ratio	
(LCR)	requirement	to	hold	sufficient	liquid	assets	to	
cover	net	cash	outflows	projected	under	a	30	day	stress	
scenario.	Under	APRAs	liquidity	prudential	standard,	CBA	
must	maintain	an	LCR	of	at	least	100%.
As	at	30June2019,	CBAs	quarterly	average	LCR	was	
132%.	This	means	that,	for	every	A$1	of	potential	net	cash	
outflow,	it	held	A$1.32	of	liquid	assets.

3.8.3  Explanation of CBAs 
revenue model
CBAs	banking	businesses	primarily	earn	their	revenue	
from	the	interest	and	fees	charged	for	loans.	Some	
banking	businesses,	such	as	Institutional	Banking	and	
Markets,	earn	fees	for	services	performed	for	customers.
The	funds	administration	businesses	earn	fees	for	
funds	administration	and	advice	services	performed	for	
customers.
The	insurance	businesses	earn	premiums	in	relation	to	
general	insurance	provided	to	customers.	Part	of	those	
premiums	are	invested	in	anticipation	of	future	liabilities	
and	therefore	the	revenue	of	these	businesses	also	
includes	investment	earnings.
The	below	two	ratios	are	examples	of	ratios	that	measure	
the	performance	of	CBAs	businesses:	
 
Operating expense to total operating income ratio
The	operating	expense	to	total	operating	income	ratio	
represents	CBAs	operating	expenses	as	a	percentage	
of	total	operating	income.	All	else	being	equal,	a	lower	
operating	expense	to	total	operating	income	ratio	
indicates	that	more	total	operating	income	may	be	
available	to	pay	Distributions.
For	the	twelve	months	to	30June2019,	CBAs	
operating	expense	to	total	operating	income	ratio	
(cash basis)	was	46.2%.	This	means	that,	for	every	
A$1	of	operating	income	it	earned,	it	had	operating	
expenses	of	A$0.462.
 
Return on equity ratio
The	return	on	equity	ratio	represents	CBAs	net	profit	
after	tax	as	a	percentage	of	its	average	shareholders	
equity.	Generally,	a	higher	return	on	equity	ratio	
indicates	that	more	profit	may	be	available	to	pay	
Distributions.
For	the	twelve	months	to	30June2019,	CBAs	return	
on	equity	ratio	(cash basis)	was	12.5%.	This	means	
that,	for	every	A$1	of	shareholders	equity	it	held,	it	
earned	net	profit	after	tax	of	A$0.125.

3.8.6 Summary of financial ratios
The	ASIC	Guidance	suggests	some	financial	ratios	which	may	assist	you	to	determine	a	companys	financial	capacity	
to	pay	interest,	and	repay	the	face	value,	on	a	bond.	CBA	does	not	calculate	these	ratios	as	they	would	not	provide	
meaningful	assistance	given	the	nature	of	CBAs	business	which	is	different	to	companies	outside	the	financial	services	
industry.	Nevertheless,	CBA	calculates	the	ratios	set	out	in	the	following	table	which	may	provide	assistance.	
See	Sections	3.8.1	Capital	adequacy,	3.8.2	Funding	and	liquidity	and	3.8.3	Explanation	of	CBAs	revenue	model	for	
detailed	explanations	of	these	ratios.

sources	and	types	of	funding.	
The	net	proceeds	of	the	Offer	will	be	used	to	fund	CBAs	business.	The	Offer	will	not	have	a	material	impact	on	CBAs

The	following	pro	forma	adjustments	show	the	changes	that	would	be	made	to	CBAs	consolidated	balance	sheet

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes
50
4.1 
Introduction
There are risks which could affect an investment in PERLS 
XII, including:
 
risks associated with PERLS XII specifically, many of 
which are outside the control of CBA; and
 
risks associated with CBAs businesses which may 
affect PERLS XII.
All principal or material risks and uncertainties that have 
been identified by CBA as at the date of this Prospectus 
are included in this section. Additional risks and 
uncertainties that CBA is unaware of, or that it currently 
deems to be immaterial, may also become important risk 
factors that affect CBA and therefore PERLS XII. This list 
of risks is not exhaustive. CBA is subject to continuous 
disclosure obligations, requiring new material information 
to be announced to the ASX.
If any of the listed or unlisted risks actually occur, CBAs 
business operations, financial condition or reputation 
could be materially adversely affected and, consequently, 
Holders of PERLS XII could lose all or part of their 
investment.
If you have any questions about these risks, you should 
seek advice from your financial or other professional 
adviser before deciding to invest in PERLS XII.
4.2 
 Risks associated with 
CommBank PERLS XII 
Capital Notes specifically 
4.2.1  Investments in PERLS XII 
are not deposit liabilities or 
protected accounts under 
the Banking Act
Investments in PERLS XII are an investment in CBA and 
may be affected by the ongoing performance, financial 
position and solvency of CBA. They are not deposit 
liabilities or protected accounts under the Banking Act. 
Therefore, PERLS XII are not guaranteed or insured 
by any Australian government, government agency 
or compensation scheme of Australia or any other 
jurisdiction.
4.2.2  Holders of PERLS XII are 
subordinated and unsecured 
creditors
In a winding up of CBA, Holders claims will rank after the 
claims of holders of Senior Ranking Obligations, creditors 
preferred by law and secured creditors.
Holders claims will rank equally with claims of holders of 
Equal Ranking Securities. This means your PERLS XII rank 
equivalently to a preference share.
Holders claims will rank ahead of claims of holders of 
Junior Ranking Securities (being holders of Ordinary 
Shares).
If, after the claims of holders of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, creditors preferred by law and secured 
creditors are satisfied there are insufficient assets to pay 
all amounts owing on PERLS XII and any Equal Ranking 
Securities, there is a risk that you may lose some or all of 
the money you invested in PERLS XII.
For further information see Sections1.1.2 Ranking of 
PERLS XII in a winding up of CBA and 2.6 How will 
CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes rank in a winding 
up?.
In addition, on Exchange, Holders will become holders of 
Ordinary Shares and rank equally with other holders of 
Ordinary Shares.
4.2.3  Distributions may not 
bepaid
Payment of a Distribution is subject to:
 
CBA, in its absolute discretion, making the Distribution 
to Holders;
 
payment not resulting in a breach of CBAs capital 
requirements under APRAs prudential standards as 
they are applied to the CBA Level 1 Group or the CBA 
Level 2 Group;
 
payment not resulting in CBA becoming, or being 
likely to become, insolvent; and
 
APRA not otherwise objecting to the payment. 
No Distribution will be paid on Exchange where Exchange 
occurs due to a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event.
Distributions may not be paid if CBAs CET1 Capital Ratio 
falls into the CCB. For further information, see Section 
3.8.1 Capital adequacy.
Distributions that are not paid do not accrue and will not 
be subsequently paid. Non-payment of a Distribution on 
the relevant Distribution Payment Date will not be an 
event of default and CBA will have no liability to Holders 
in respect of the unpaid Distribution. However, from that 
Distribution Payment Date and until a Distribution is 
paid in full on a subsequent Distribution Payment Date 
(or all PERLS XII are Exchanged, Redeemed or otherwise 
terminated), CBA cannot (subject to certain exceptions):
 
declare or determine a dividend on Ordinary Shares; 
or
 
return any capital or undertake any buy-backs or 
repurchases in relation to Ordinary Shares. 
To prevent these restrictions from occurring, CBA must 
pay all Distributions when scheduled, or, if all or any 
part of a Distribution is not paid when scheduled, in 
full within 5 Business Days of the Distribution Payment 
Date. Therefore, CBA would expect to give priority to 
payments of Distributions and other similar Tier 1 Capital 
distributions to enable CBA to be able to continue paying 
Ordinary Share dividends.
Further, under the terms of some other securities issued 
by CBA, CBA may not be able to pay Distributions if it 
does not pay distributions on those other securities. If 
this occurs, the dividend and capital restrictions outlined 
above will apply.

4.2.4  PERLS XII may be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares on the 
Mandatory Exchange Date or if certain events occur
PERLS XII do not have a fixed maturity date but may be Exchanged into Ordinary Shares, Redeemed or Resold. The 
diagram below summarises when these events could occur. If none of these events occur, PERLS XII could remain on 
issue indefinitely and the Face Value will not be repaid.

Mandatory Exchange Date 
(if not Redeemed on the Call 
Date or Exchanged earlier)
If Mandatory Exchange does not 
occur on the Mandatory Exchange 
Date, then Mandatory Exchange 
will occur on the first Distribution 
Date after that date on which the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions 
are satisfied (see Section 2.3 
Mandatory Exchange).
Maximum Exchange Number 
calculated based on 50% of Issue 
Date VWAP.
Each Distribution Payment Date 
after Mandatory Exchange Date
4.2.4.1  Holders may receive Ordinary Shares 
on the Mandatory Exchange Date
Unless Redeemed or Exchanged earlier, PERLS XII must 
be Exchanged on the Mandatory Exchange Date (subject 
to the Mandatory Exchange Conditions).
Normally, you will receive a variable number of Ordinary 
Shares with a value equal to A$101.01 (based on the 
Initial Face Value of A$100 and the VWAP of Ordinary 
Shares with the benefit of a 1% discount, see Section 2.3 
Mandatory Exchange). For example, if the VWAP of 
Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Exchange Date 
is A$75, you would receive 1.3468 Ordinary Shares per 
PERLS XII. If the Ordinary Share price on the Exchange 
Date remained A$75, this would have a market value of 
A$101.01.
However, CBA will only be required to Exchange PERLS 
XII if all the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied 
(see Section 2.3 Mandatory Exchange). For example, if 
the Issue Date VWAP is A$81, then: 
 
under the First Mandatory Exchange Condition, if the 
VWAP of Ordinary Shares on the 25th Business Day 
before the Mandatory Exchange Date is greater than 
A$45.36, the First Mandatory Exchange Condition 
would be satisfied; 
 
under the Second Mandatory Exchange Condition, 
if the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during the period 
of 20Business Days before the Mandatory 
Exchange Date is greater than A$40.91, then the 
Second Mandatory Exchange Condition would be 
satisfied;and
 
under the Third Mandatory Exchange Condition, if the 
Ordinary Shares are listed or admitted to trading on 
ASX as at the date of the Mandatory Exchange Date, 
then the Third Mandatory Exchange Condition would 
be satisfied. 
If any of these Mandatory Exchange Conditions are not 
satisfied, it means that the Ordinary Share price has 
fallen below these levels during the relevant periods 
and Exchange will not occur. If Exchange does not occur, 
you will continue to hold your PERLS XII until the first 
Distribution Payment Date after that date on which all the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied at which 
time Exchange will occur.
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less 
than A$101.01 in some circumstances, including:
 
if the Face Value has previously been reduced 
(following a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event); or
 
to realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you sell 
them on ASX at the prevailing market price. However, 
depending on the time you decide to sell and the 
market price at that time, it is possible that your sale 
proceeds may be less than the Face Value.

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes (continued)
Section 4
4.2.4.2  Holders may receive Ordinary 
Sharesupon the occurrence of a 
CapitalTrigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event
Unless Redeemed or Exchanged earlier, PERLS XII must 
be Exchanged upon the occurrence of a Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply. 
Therefore, CBA will be required to Exchange PERLS XII 
in all circumstances, regardless of the level at which 
the Ordinary Share price is trading, and the Maximum 
Exchange Number may limit the number of Ordinary 
Shares you receive.
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less 
than A$101.01 in some circumstances, including:
 
if the Face Value has previously been reduced 
(following a previous Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event);
 
the maximum number of Ordinary Shares that you 
can receive is limited to a number calculated based on 
20% of the Issue Date VWAP. For example, if the Issue 
Date VWAP is A$81, then the Maximum Exchange 
Number would be 6.1728 Ordinary Shares per PERLS 
XII;and
 
to realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you sell 
them on ASX at the prevailing market price. However, 
depending on the time you decide to sell and the 
market price at that time, it is possible that your sale 
proceeds may be less than the Face Value.
If you wish to sell your Ordinary Shares, there is also a risk 
that Ordinary Shares may no longer be listed on ASX at 
the time of Exchange upon the occurrence of a Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event and you may 
not be able to sell your Ordinary Shares at all.
4.2.4.3  Holders may receive Ordinary Shares 
upon the occurrence of a Change of 
Control Event
Unless Redeemed or Exchanged earlier, PERLS XII 
must be Exchanged upon the occurrence of a Change 
of Control Event (subject to the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions applying with the modifications in Clause 
4.7(c) of the Terms).
The consequences of Exchange in this situation are the 
same as for Mandatory Exchange (see Section 4.2.4.1 
Holders may receive Ordinary Shares on the Mandatory 
Exchange Date). 
4.2.4.4  Consequences of holding Ordinary 
Shares
Ordinary Shares are a different type of investment to 
PERLS XII. Dividends on Ordinary Shares are payable 
at the absolute discretion of CBA and the amount of 
each dividend is discretionary (not subject to a formula). 
In contrast, Distributions on PERLS XII are payable in 
accordance with the formulae in Clauses 2.2 and 2.3 
of the Terms and subject to the Distribution payment 
conditions in Clause 2.5 of the Terms. In a winding up of 
CBA, claims of holders of Ordinary Shares rank behind 
claims of holders of all other securities and debts of CBA. 
In contrast, claims of PERLS XII holders rank ahead of 
holders of Ordinary Shares.
Ordinary Shares are an equity security and may trade at 
a market price which is different to a hybrid security such 
as PERLS XII. The market price of Ordinary Shares may 
be more sensitive than that of PERLS XII to changes in 
CBAs performance, operational issues and other business 
issues.
4.2.5  A Capital Trigger Event or 
Non-Viability Trigger Event 
may occur
4.2.5.1  Definition of Capital Trigger Event and 
Non-Viability Trigger Event
A Capital Trigger Event occurs when CBA determines, or 
APRA notifies CBA in writing that it believes, that either 
or both the CBA Level 1 CET1 Capital Ratio or CBA Level 2 
CET1 Capital Ratio is equal to or less than 5.125%.
The CET1 Capital Ratio is the ratio of CBAs CET1 Capital 
to its RWA, where CET1 Capital is the strongest form of 
capital held by CBA.
If a Capital Trigger Event occurs, CBA must immediately 
Exchange such number of PERLS XII (or a percentage of 
the Face Value of each PERLS XII) to return either or both 
the CBA Level 1 CET1 Capital Ratio or CBA Level 2 CET1 
Capital Ratio, as the case may be, to above 5.125%.
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies 
CBA in writing that it believes:
 
Exchange of all or some PERLS XII (or the taking of 
any action in relation to other capital instruments of 
the CBA Group) is necessary because, without it, CBA 
would become non-viable; or
 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it CBA would 
become non-viable.
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, CBA must 
immediately Exchange such number of PERLS XII 
(or a percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII) as 
specified by APRA or necessary to satisfy APRA that CBA 
will no longer be non-viable. In the case of a public sector 
injection of capital, or equivalent support, all PERLS XII 
must be Exchanged.
4.2.5.2  Examples of situations in which a  
Non-Viability Trigger Event may occur
Whether a Non-Viability Trigger Event will occur is at the 
discretion of APRA and there are currently no precedents. 
The circumstances in which APRA may exercise its 
discretion are not limited to when APRA may have a 
concern about a banks capital levels but may also include 
a banks funding and liquidity levels.
In Section 4.3 Risks associated with CBAs businesses 
which may affect CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes, a 
number of general risks associated with CBAs businesses 
are outlined. If one, or a combination, of these risks leads to 
a significant capital loss, or prolonged difficulties in raising 
funding or maintaining sufficient liquidity, this may be the 
For personal use only

PERLS XII Prospectus
type of situation in which APRA may become concerned 
and notify CBA that it has become non-viable. The risks 
outlined in Section 4.3 Risks associated with CBAs 
business which may affect CommBank PERLS XII Capital 
Notes are examples only and not exhaustive, andthere 
may be other risks which affect the performance of CBA.
4.2.5.3  Consequences of the occurrence of a 
Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event
The inclusion of the Capital Trigger Event and  
Non-Viability Trigger Event in the terms of capital 
securities has been a requirement under APRAs 
prudential standards since 1 January 2013.
In the past, if a bank experienced financial difficulty 
and needed to accept public or private assistance or 
investment, holders of capital securities would be subject 
to the arrangements negotiated on their behalf by the 
bank with the Government or private investors (as the 
case may be) at the time. The nature and terms of those 
arrangements were uncertain until that time arose.
The inclusion of the Capital Trigger Event and  
Non-Viability Trigger Event is intended to provide an 
advanced framework for the treatment of Holders if CBA 
experiences significant financial difficulty. Upon the 
occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, CBA must immediately Exchange all or 
some PERLS XII (or a percentage of the Face Value of 
each PERLS XII). 
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply and 
the Terms provide that Exchange occurs automatically 
without the need for any further act or step by CBA and 
that CBA will recognise Holders as having been issued 
Ordinary Shares. 
Any ASX trades in PERLS XII that have not settled on the 
date a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
occurs will continue to settle in accordance with the normal 
ASX T+2 settlement, although the seller will be treated as 
having delivered, and the buyer will be treated as having 
acquired, the number of Ordinary Shares into which PERLS 
XII have been Exchanged as a result of the occurrence of 
the Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event.
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs because there has 
been a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, all PERLS XII must be Exchanged.
However, the number of Ordinary Shares you will receive 
is limited to the Maximum Exchange Number. For further 
information about the consequences of the application 
of the Maximum Exchange Number, see Section 
4.2.4.2 Holders may receive Ordinary Shares upon the 
occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event. 
If the Exchange fails to take effect for any reason and CBA 
has not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to 
be issued in respect of such Exchange within 5 Business 
Days, then Holders rights under the relevant PERLS XII 
will be immediately and irrevocably terminated and such 
termination will be taken to have occurred immediately 
on the date of the occurrence of the Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event. Your investment 
in the relevant PERLS XII will lose all of its value  the 
Face Value will not be repaid and you will not receive any 
compensation. This could occur if CBA was prevented 
from issuing Ordinary Shares by circumstances outside its 
control, for example, if CBA was prevented by a specified 
law or order of any court, or action of any government 
authority, from issuing Ordinary Shares.
4.2.5.4  CBA proactively manages its capital, 
funding and liquidity positions to avoid 
experiencing financial difficulty
CBA conservatively and proactively manages its capital, 
funding and liquidity positions to avoid experiencing 
financial difficulty. 
For further information about CBAs capital, funding and 
liquidity positions, how they are managed and the CBA 
Level 2 CET1 Capital Ratio surplus above the level of 
5.125%, see Section 3.8.1 Capital adequacy and Section 
3.8.2 Funding and liquidity. However, there are a 
number of risks which are wholly or partly outside CBAs 
control as discussed in Section 4.3 below. 
4.2.6  PERLS XII may not be 
Exchanged on the Scheduled 
Mandatory Exchange Date
PERLS XII may not be Exchanged on the Scheduled 
Mandatory Exchange Date because the Mandatory 
Exchange Conditions are not satisfied. This could 
occur, for example, because the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions are not satisfied due to a large fall in the 
Ordinary Share price relative to the Issue Date VWAP, or if 
the Ordinary Shares are Delisted. 
The market price of Ordinary Shares is relevant to 
determining whether Exchange will occur, and also the 
number of Ordinary Shares a Holder will receive on 
Exchange. The market price of Ordinary Shares may be 
impacted by transactions affecting the share capital of 
CBA, such as rights issues, placements, returns of capital, 
buy-backs, demergers, and other corporate actions. 
However, the Issue Date VWAP is adjusted only for pro-
rata bonus issues of Ordinary Shares and certain types 
of capital reconstructions as described in Clauses 7.5 and 
7.6 of the Terms and not for other types of corporate 
transactions such as those mentioned above. The Terms 
do not limit the transactions which CBA is permitted to 
undertake with respect to its share capital. 
If Exchange does not occur, then (unless Exchange occurs 
in the meantime pursuant to a Capital Trigger Event and 
Non-Viability Trigger Event  see Section 4.2.5 A Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event may occur) 
you will continue to hold your PERLS XII until the first 
Distribution Payment Date after that date on which all 
the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied. PERLS 
XII are a perpetual security and it is possible that the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions may never be satisfied 
and that PERLS XII may never be Exchanged.
To realise your investment, you can sell your PERLS XII on 
ASX at the prevailing market price. However, depending 
on market conditions at the time, PERLS XII may be 
trading at a market price below the Face Value and/or the 
market for PERLS XII may not be liquid.

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes (continued)
Section 4
4.2.7  CBA may Redeem, or procure 
a Resale of, PERLS XII in 
certain circumstances 
CBA has the right to Redeem PERLS XII or choose that 
Resale occur on the Call Date, or Redeem PERLS XII at 
any time for tax or regulatory reasons or if it is unable to 
frank Distributions. CBAs right to Redeem PERLS XII is 
subject to prior written approval from APRA. Approval is 
at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given.
The timing or occurrence of the Redemption or Resale 
may not coincide with your individual preferences.
In addition, if PERLS XII are Redeemed for tax or 
regulatory reasons or because CBA is unable to frank 
Distributions then, depending on market conditions at 
the time, you may not be able to reinvest the amount you 
receive on Redemption at a similar rate of return to the 
rate of return you expected on your PERLS XII if you had 
continued to hold them. 
4.2.8  Holders do not have a 
right to request that their 
PERLS XII be Exchanged or 
Redeemed early
Holders do not have a right to request that their PERLS 
XII be Exchanged or Redeemed early for any reason.
To realise your investment, you can sell your PERLS XII on 
ASX at the prevailing market price. However, depending on 
market conditions at the time, PERLS XII may be trading at 
a market price below the Face Value and/or the market for 
PERLS XII may not be liquid. For further information about 
liquidity risks associated with PERLS XII, see Section 4.2.12 
The liquidity of PERLS XII may below. 
4.2.9  CBA may raise more debt 
and issue other securities
CBA has the right in its absolute discretion to issue 
additional Senior Ranking Obligations, Equal Ranking 
Securities or Junior Ranking Securities which may: 
 
rank for dividends or payments of capital (including 
on the winding-up of CBA) equal with, behind or 
ahead of PERLS XII; 
 
have the same or different dividend, interest or 
distribution rates as PERLS XII;
 
have payment tests and distribution restrictions 
or other covenants which may affect PERLS XII 
(including by restricting circumstances in which 
Distributions can be paid on PERLS XII or PERLS XII 
can be Redeemed); or
 
have the same or different terms and conditions as 
PERLS XII.
The Terms do not contain any covenants preventing 
CBA from raising more debt or issuing other securities, 
requiring CBA to refrain from certain business changes, or 
requiring CBA to operate within certain ratio limits.
A Holding of PERLS XII does not confer any right to 
participate in further issues of securities by CBA.
It is difficult to anticipate the effect such debt or other 
issues of securities may have on the market price or 
liquidity of PERLS XII.
4.2.10  The Distribution Rate will 
fluctuate
The Distribution Rate is a floating rate, based on the 
Market Rate (which is a floating rate) plus the Margin 
(which is fixed). The Market Rate will fluctuate and 
therefore the Distribution Rate will fluctuate. Over the 
term of PERLS XII, the Distribution Rate may be higher or 
lower than the initial Distribution Rate on the Issue Date. 
It is possible for the Market Rate to become negative. 
Should this occur, the negative amount will be taken into 
account in calculating the Distribution Rate.
If the Distribution Rate decreases, there is a risk that 
the return on PERLS XII may become less attractive 
compared to returns on comparable securities or 
investments.
CBA does not guarantee any particular rate of return on 
PERLS XII.
4.2.11  The market price of 
PERLSXII will fluctuate
CBA will apply for quotation of PERLS XII on ASX. The 
market price of PERLS XII on ASX will fluctuate due to 
various factors, including:
 
changes in Australian and international economic 
conditions, interest rates, credit margins, inflation 
rates and foreign exchange rates;
 
if CBAs financial performance or position declines, or 
if market participants anticipate that it may decline, an 
investment in PERLS XII could decline in value even if 
PERLS XII have not been Exchanged;
 
changes to CBAs credit rating. For further information 
about the impacts of credit ratings on CBA, see 
Section 4.3.14 CBAs results may be adversely affected 
by liquidity and funding risks;
 
movements in the market price of equity and/or other 
debt issued by CBA or by other issuers;
 
changes in investor perceptions and sentiment in 
relation to CBA or the financial services industry; and
 
other major Australian and international events, such 
as hostilities and tensions, and acts of terrorism.
PERLS XII may trade at a market price below the Face 
Value during this time and the market price may be more 
sensitive than that of equity to changes in interest rates, 
credit margins and other market prices.
If PERLS XII trade at a market price below the amount at 
which you acquired them, there is a risk that, if you sell 
them, you may lose some of the money you invested.
CBA does not guarantee the market price of PERLS XII.
4.2.12  The liquidity of PERLS XII 
may be low
The market on ASX for PERLS XII may not be liquid and 
may be less liquid than that of Ordinary Shares.
If liquidity is low, there is a risk that, if you wish to sell 
your PERLS XII, you may not be able to do so at a price 
acceptable to you or at all.

4.2.13  Holders may be subject to 
FATCA withholding and 
information reporting
The objective of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance 
Act (FATCA) is to target tax non-compliance by US 
taxpayers with foreign financial assets, and requires 
reporting of such financial assets by third parties.
In order to comply with FATCA, it is possible that CBA (or, 
if PERLS XII are held through another financial institution, 
that other financial institution) may be required 
(pursuant to an agreement with the IRS or otherwise 
under applicable law) to request certain information 
from Holders or beneficial owners of PERLS XII, which 
information may in turn be provided to the IRS or other 
relevant tax authority. 
If CBA or any other person is required to withhold 
amounts as a result of Holders and beneficial owners 
of PERLS XII not providing the required information or 
documentation, then those Holders and beneficial owners 
will not be entitled to receive any gross up or additional 
amounts to compensate them for such withholding. 
This information is based on guidance issued by the 
IRS or other relevant tax authority as at the date of this 
Prospectus. Future guidance may affect the application of 
FATCA to CBA, Holders or beneficial owners of PERLS XII.
In addition, the OECD Common Reporting Standard for 
the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information 
(CRS) requires certain financial institutions to report 
financial information regarding certain accounts to their 
local tax authority. The CRS applies to Australian financial 
institutions from 1 July 2017. Holders may be requested 
to provide certain information to ensure compliance 
with CRS. This information may be provided to the 
Australian Taxation Office which, in turn, may provide this 
information to other countries that have signed the CRS 
Competent Authority Agreement.
4.2.14 CBA may amend the Terms
CBA may amend the Terms in two ways:
 
without the consent of Holders and subject to 
compliance with relevant laws  as set out in the 
Terms, including if the amendment is of a formal, 
technical or minor nature; to correct an error; to 
facilitate the listing; to comply with relevant laws; to 
amend any date or time period in connection with 
any Exchange, Resale or Redemption; where there is 
no material prejudice; or to enable the substitution of 
a NOHC as the debtor of PERLS XII provided certain 
substitution conditions are satisfied; and
 
with the consent of Holders  if a Special Resolution is 
passed.
In both cases, the Terms of all PERLS XII will be amended. 
In particular in the latter case, Holders who did not vote 
with the majority will be subject to the amended Terms 
which may not coincide with their individual preferences.
CBA may also amend the Terms in circumstances where 
the Market Rate ceases to be available (i.e. a Market Rate 
Disruption Event occurs) and replace the Market Rate 
with an alternative rate that CBA considers appropriate 
(in some cases subject to APRAs prior written approval), 
acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable 
manner, and make certain other consequential 
amendments to the Terms. Such amendments could 
adversely affect the interests of PERLS XII Holders.
Certain amendments require prior written approval from 
APRA. Approval is at the discretion of APRA and may or 
may not be given.
4.2.15  CBA may substitute for itself 
a non-operating holding 
company (NOHC)
CBA may substitute for itself a NOHC as the debtor in 
respect of PERLS XII or as the issuer of ordinary shares on 
Exchange. If a NOHC is substituted as the debtor it means 
that you would no longer have rights against CBA. If a 
NOHC is substituted as the issuer of ordinary shares on 
Exchange it means that you will receive ordinary shares in 
the NOHC rather than CBA.
Although not currently contemplated, the 
implementation of a NOHC structure may involve 
CBA selling some but not all of its business, and other 
subsidiaries, to the NOHC or a subsidiary of the NOHC. As 
a result, the profits and net asset position of CBA and the 
NOHC may be different to that of CBA prior to the NOHC 
structure being implemented.
4.2.16  Powers of an ADI Statutory 
Manager and of APRA
In certain circumstances, APRA may appoint a statutory 
manager to take control of the business of an Australian 
ADI, including CBA. The statutory manager has specific 
powers to take certain actions which may affect the 
ongoing operation of CBA and therefore its financial 
position which is relevant to PERLS XII.
4.3  
 Risks associated with CBAs 
businesses which may 
affect CommBank PERLS XII 
Capital Notes 
4.3.1  CBA is subject to extensive 
regulation and operates 
in an environment of 
political scrutiny, which 
could adversely impact its 
operations and financial 
condition
CBA and its businesses are subject to extensive regulation 
in Australia and across multiple regulatory bodies as well 
as other regulators in jurisdictions in which CBA operates 
or obtains funding, including New Zealand, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, China, Japan, Europe, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia.
Key domestic regulators include APRA, ASIC, AUSTRAC, 
the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, 
the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, 
the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, the RBA 
and the ASX.

Section 4
APRA, as CBAs prudential regulator in Australia has very 
wide powers under the Banking Act, including in limited 
circumstances to direct banks (including CBA) not to 
make payments on their securities.
In addition to its key Australian regulators, a range 
of international regulators and authorities supervise 
and regulate CBA in respect of, among other areas, 
capital adequacy, liquidity levels, funding, provisioning, 
insurances, compliance with prudential regulation and 
standards, accounting standards, remuneration, data 
access, stock exchange listing requirements, and its 
compliance with relevant financial crime, sanction, 
privacy, taxation, competition, consumer protection and 
securities trading laws.
CBA and the wider financial services industry are 
facing increased regulation in many of these areas and 
jurisdictions and changes or new regulation in one part of 
the world could lead to changes elsewhere.
Any change in law, regulation, accounting standards, 
policy or practice of regulators, or failure to comply 
with laws, regulation or policy, may adversely affect 
CBAs business, financial condition, liquidity, operations, 
prospects and its reputation, and its ability to execute 
its strategy, either on a short-term or long-term basis. 
The potential impacts of regulatory change are wide, 
and could include increasing the levels and types of 
capital CBA is required to hold and restricting the way 
CBA can conduct its business and the nature of that 
business, such as the types of products that it can offer 
to customers.
CBA may also be adversely affected if the pace or extent 
of such regulatory change exceeds CBAs ability to adapt 
to such changes and embed appropriate compliance 
processes adequately. The pace of regulatory change 
means that the regulatory context in which CBA operates 
is often uncertain and complex.
4.3.1.1 Regulatory reforms
Examples of significant regulatory reform under 
development in Australia include a review of Open 
Banking (as defined below), APRAs proposals to revise 
the capital framework for ADIs and the Treasury Laws 
Amendment (Design and Distribution Obligations and 
Product Intervention Powers) Act 2019.
 
In late 2017, the Australian Government announced 
it would legislate an economy-wide Consumer Data 
Right (CDR) to give consumers access to and control 
over their data, beginning with banking (referred to 
as Open Banking). The Australian Government has 
decided to phase in Open Banking with the major 
banks to make product data available for credit and 
debit card, deposit and transaction accounts from July 
2019, before expanding to other banking products 
(e.g. mortgages) and sharing of consumer data 
between major banks and accredited third parties 
(at the direction of the consumer) for credit and 
debit card, deposit and transaction accounts from 
February 2020. These reforms are intended to increase 
competition in the financial sector and improve 
customer outcomes. CDR laws have now been passed 
by the Federal Parliament in Australia , with the 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 
CDR Rules to be passed and Data Standards to be 
finalised. Increased competition resulting from Open 
Banking may adversely impact CBAs business and 
financial condition.
 
The finalisation of the capital reforms, which are 
currently under consultation with APRA, may result in 
changes to the risk-weighting framework for certain 
asset classes, which are expected to increase CBAs 
RWA and accordingly (all things being equal) reduce 
CBAs CET1 Capital Ratio. As part of the revisions to 
the capital framework, APRA is also consulting with 
the industry on approaches for achieving international 
comparability, without changing the quantum amount 
of CET1 Capital ADIs are required to hold. In addition, 
on 9 July 2019, APRA announced its decision on the 
LAC to support the orderly resolution of Australian 
ADIs, which increased the total capital requirement 
for domestically systemically important banks, such as 
CBA, by 3%. APRA has stated that, over the next four 
years, it may consider feasible alternatives to further 
increase the LAC by an additional 1-2%. The form of 
such alternatives remains uncertain, and APRA has 
indicated that it expects to consult with the industry 
and other stakeholders.
 
The finalisation of these proposals may have the 
following impacts: 
 
implications for the CCB which may affect the 
payment of Distributions (see Section 3.8.1.3 
Potential impact of falling into the capital 
conservation buffer for more information on the 
CCB);
 
further changes to the risk-weighting framework 
for certain asset classes, which are expected to 
increase CBAs RWA and accordingly (all things 
being equal) reduce CBAs CET1 Capital Ratio 
which may affect the risk of a Capital Trigger Event 
occurring (see Section 2.4 Automatic Exchange on 
a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-Viability Trigger 
Event and Section 4.2.5 A Capital Trigger Event or 
Non-Viability Trigger Event may occur); and/or
 
adjustments to an ADIs existing minimum 
CET1 Capital Ratios may increase the PCR 
and CCB components, which may result in 
APRA determining that a Capital Trigger Event 
percentage higher than 5.125% is appropriate. At 
this stage, the potential impact on PERLS XII and 
other Equal Ranking Securities remains uncertain. 
Potential scenarios for PERLS XII include:
 
CBA may have an early redemption right 
(subject to APRAs approval) under Clause 5.4 
of the Terms;
 
CBA may amend the Terms without 
the consent of Holders to adjust to a 
higher CapitalTrigger Event percentage 
(Clause 12.3(d)(ii)); or
 
APRA may grandfather PERLS XII and other 
Equal Ranking Securities currently on issue, i.e. 
capital adequacy (as detailed in Section 3.8.1 
Capital adequacy), may be assessed under 
the existing or revised APRA Prudential 
Standards.

PERLS XII Prospectus
 
The Treasury Laws Amendment (Design and 
Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention 
Powers) Act 2019 (Cth) came into force on 5 April 
2019 and introduced both design and distribution 
obligations on certain issuers and distributors of 
financial products (including hybrid securities) to retail 
investors and new product intervention powers for 
ASIC. The product design and distribution obligations 
have a two year transitional period and therefore do 
not come into force until April 2021. Relevantly, the 
product design and distribution obligations require 
issuers to prepare and make publicly available a 
target market determination (TMD), which aims 
to ensure that financial products for the retail market 
are targeted and sold to appropriate investors. Issuers 
must then take reasonable steps to ensure compliance 
with the TMD by distributors and are subject to 
ongoing obligations to review the TMD. Distributors 
must not distribute a product to retail investors unless 
it has a TMD and must also take reasonable steps to 
ensure their distribution is consistent with the TMD. 
ASIC is expected to provide regulatory guidance in 
respect of the design and distribution obligations by 
the end of 2019. The impact of these new obligations 
remains untested, however there is a risk that they 
may adversely impact the issue, distribution and 
reinvestment of financial products in the future, 
including instruments like PERLS XII. These changes 
may also affect the liquidity of funding instruments 
(including hybrids such as PERLS XII), if they lead to 
a material reduction in future issuance volumes or 
secondary trading activity by investors.
Outside Australia there have also been a series of other 
regulatory initiatives from authorities in the various 
jurisdictions in which CBA operates or obtains funding 
that would result in significant regulatory changes for 
financial institutions.
As an example, and as outlined in Section 3.8.1.5 
Regulatory developments, the Reserve Bank of New 
Zealand is undertaking a comprehensive review of the 
capital adequacy framework applying to registered banks 
in New Zealand. Among the proposals being considered 
is an increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement 
for banks which are deemed systemically important to 
16% of RWA (currently 8.5%). It is possible that such 
proposals, if implemented, could impact CBAs capital 
minimums and targets.
4.3.1.2  Other regulatory and political 
developments
There is currently an environment of heightened scrutiny 
by the Australian Government and various Australian 
regulators on the Australian financial services industry. 
An example of industry-wide scrutiny that may lead 
to future changes in laws, regulation or policies, is the 
establishment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the 
misconduct by financial service entities. 
The Royal Commission was established on  
14 December 2017 and was authorised to inquire 
into misconduct by financial service entities 
(including the CBA Group). Seven rounds of hearings 
into misconduct in the banking and financial services 
industry were held throughout 2018, covering a variety 
of topics including consumer and business lending, 
financial advice, superannuation, insurance and a policy 
round. The Royal Commissions final report was delivered 
on 1 February 2019. The final report included 76 policy 
recommendations to the Australian Government and 
findings in relation to the case studies investigated during 
the hearings, with a number of referrals being made to 
regulators for misconduct by financial institutions, which 
has resulted in heightened levels of enforcement action 
across the industry including key regulators investigating 
all matters raised by the Royal Commission. 
The 76 recommendations covered many of CBAs business 
areas, and also canvassed the role of the regulators and 
the approach to be taken to customer focus, culture 
and remuneration. The recommendations regarding the 
role of regulators, in particular ASICs why not litigate 
approach for breaches of financial services law, will likely 
lead to a change in CBAs regulator relationships and CBA 
is seeing an increase in investigation and litigation activity, 
which could potentially have a cumulative impact on costs 
and reputation. CBA released a statement to the ASX on 
8 March 2019 welcoming the final report and committing 
to actions to deliver on the recommendations.
4.3.2   CBA may be adversely 
affected by damage to its 
reputation
The CBA Groups reputation is a valuable asset and a 
key contributor to the support that it receives from the 
community for its business initiatives and its ability to 
raise funding or capital. Damage to CBAs reputation may 
arise where there are differences between stakeholder 
expectations and CBAs actual or perceived practices. The 
risk of reputational damage may also be a secondary 
outcome of other sources of risk. 
Various issues, including a number of the risks described 
in this Section 4.3, may give rise to reputational damage 
and cause harm to CBAs business, financial condition, 
operations and prospects. These issues include the CBA 
Groups conduct (for example, inadequate sales and 
trading practices, inappropriate management of conflicts 
of interest and other ethical issues), breaches of legal 
and regulatory requirements (such as money laundering, 
counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions privacy and 
anti-hawking laws), technology and information security 
failures, unsuccessful strategies or strategies that are not 
in line with community expectations and non-compliance 
with internal policies and procedures. CBAs reputation 
may also be adversely affected by community perception 
of the broader financial services industry, or from the 
actions of its competitors, customers, suppliers, or 
companies in which CBA holds strategic investments. 
Failure, or perceived failure, to address these issues 
appropriately could also give rise to additional legal or 
regulatory risk, subjecting CBA to regulatory enforcement 
actions, fines and penalties, or further damage its 
reputation and integrity among its stakeholders including 
customers, investors and the community.

Section 4
4.3.3   CBA may be adversely 
impacted by a downturn 
in the Australian or New 
Zealand economies
As CBAs businesses are primarily located in Australia 
and New Zealand, CBAs performance is dependent on 
the state of these economies, customer and investor 
confidence, and prevailing market conditions in these two 
countries.
CBA can give no assurances as to the likely future 
conditions of the Australian and New Zealand economies, 
which can be influenced by many factors within and 
outside these countries, which are outside CBAs control, 
including domestic and international economic events, 
political events, natural disasters and any other event that 
impacts global financial markets.
China is one of Australias major trading partners and a 
significant driver of commodity demand and prices in 
many of the markets in which CBA and its customers 
operate. Anything that adversely affects Chinas economic 
growth, including the implementation of tariffs or other 
protectionist trade policy, could adversely affect Australian 
economic activity and, as a result, CBAs business, 
financial condition, operations and prospects. 
The strength of the Australian economy is influenced 
by the strength of the Australian dollar. Significant 
movements in the Australian dollar may adversely impact 
parts of the Australian economy and, in turn, CBAs results 
of operations as described in Section 4.3.16. 
A material downturn in the Australian or New Zealand 
economies could adversely impact future results by 
reducing customers demand for CBAs products and 
borrowers ability to repay their loans to CBA (i.e. credit 
risk). In particular, given CBAs concentration of earnings 
from home loans, a significant or sustained decrease 
in the Australian and New Zealand housing markets 
or property valuations, including external factors or 
tightening lending standards could adversely affect 
CBAs home and commercial mortgage portfolio, result 
in a decrease in the amount of new lending CBA is able 
to undertake and/or increase the losses that CBA may 
experience from existing loans. These factors could 
adversely affect CBAs business, financial condition, 
operations and prospects.
4.3.4  CBA may be adversely 
affected by deteriorations in 
the global financial markets 
By the nature of its operations in various financial 
markets, CBA has previously been adversely impacted, 
both directly and indirectly, by difficult business, 
economic and market conditions and could be adversely 
affected should markets deteriorate again in the future. 
The financial system (or systems) within which CBA 
operates may experience systemic shock due to market 
volatility, political or economic instability or catastrophic 
events. 
A shock to or deterioration in the global economy could 
result in currency and interest rate fluctuations and 
operational disruptions that negatively impact the CBA 
Group. For example, global economic conditions may 
deteriorate to the extent that counterparties default on 
their debt obligations; countries re-denominate their 
currencies and/or introduce capital controls; one or 
more major economies collapse; and/or global financial 
markets cease to operate, or cease to operate efficiently. 
Sovereign defaults may adversely impact CBA directly, 
through adversely impacting the value of CBA assets, or 
indirectly through destabilising global financial markets, 
adversely impacting CBAs liquidity, financial performance 
or ability to access capital.
4.3.5  CBA is subject to intense 
competition which may 
adversely affect its results
CBA faces intense competition in all of its principal 
areas of operation. Competition is expected to increase, 
especially from non-Australian financial services providers 
who continue to expand in Australia, and from new 
non-bank entrants or smaller providers who may be 
unregulated or subject to lower or different prudential 
and regulatory standards than CBA and are therefore able 
to operate more efficiently. These entrants may seek to 
disrupt the financial services industry by offering bundled 
propositions and utilising new technologies. 
If CBA is unable to compete effectively in its various 
businesses and markets, its market share may decline and 
increased competition may also adversely affect CBAs 
results by diverting business to competitors or creating 
pressure to lower margins to maintain market share.
4.3.6  CBA may incur losses from 
operational risks associated 
with being a large financial 
institution
Operational risk is defined as the risk of economic gain 
or loss resulting from: (i) inadequate or failed internal 
processes and methodologies; (ii) people; (iii) systems 
and models used in making business decisions; or (iv) 
external events.
CBAs use of third party suppliers and third party 
partnerships, especially those where they supply CBA 
with critical services such as key technology systems or 
support, also expose it to operational risks, including the 
potential for a severe event at a third party impacting CBA.
CBAs businesses are highly dependent on their 
ability to process and monitor a very large number of 
transactions, many of which are highly complex, across 
multiple markets and in many currencies. CBAs financial, 
accounting, record-keeping, data processing or other 
operating systems, processes and facilities may fail to 
function properly or may become disabled as a result 
of events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, 
such as a spike in transaction volumes, damage to critical 
utilities, environmental hazard, natural disaster, or a 
failure of vendors systems. CBA could suffer losses due 
to impairment of assets, including software, goodwill and 
other intangible assets.
For personal use only
59
PERLS XII Prospectus
There is also a risk that poor decisions may be made due 
to data quality issues, models that are not fit for purpose, 
or inappropriate data management. This may cause CBA 
to incur losses, or result in regulatory action.
Management must exercise judgment in selecting and 
applying CBAs accounting policies so that not only 
do they comply with generally accepted accounting 
principles but they also reflect the most appropriate 
manner in which to record and report on the financial 
position and results of operations of CBA. Application of 
and changes to accounting policies may adversely impact 
CBAs results.
CBA may also be adversely impacted by failures in 
the efficacy, adequacy or implementation of its risk-
management strategies, frameworks and processes. The 
emergence of unexpected risks or unanticipated impacts 
of identified risks may result in financial or reputational 
losses for CBA.
4.3.7   CBA may be adversely 
impacted by information 
security risks, including 
cyber-attacks
CBAs businesses are highly dependent on its information 
technology systems, including those supplied by external 
service providers, to securely process, store, keep 
private and transmit information. These information 
technology systems are subject to information security 
risks. Information security risks for CBA have increased 
in recent years, in part because of: (i) the pervasiveness 
of technology to conduct financial transactions; (ii) the 
evolution and development of new technologies; (iii) 
CBAs increasing usage of digital channels; (iv) customers 
increasing use of personal devices that are beyond CBAs 
control systems; and (v) the increased sophistication and 
broadened activities of cyber criminals.
Although CBA takes protective measures and endeavours 
to modify these protective measures as circumstances 
warrant, its computer systems, software and networks 
may be vulnerable to unauthorised access, misuse, denial-
of-service attacks, phishing attacks, computer viruses or 
other malicious code and other events. These threats 
could result in the unauthorised release, gathering, 
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, 
proprietary and other information of CBA, its employees, 
customers or third parties or otherwise adversely impact 
network access or business operations.
An information security failure (including the impact of 
any cyber-attack), or more general mishandling of data, 
could have serious consequences for CBA, including 
operational disruption, financial losses, a loss of customer 
or business opportunities, litigation, regulatory penalties 
or intervention, reputational damage, theft of intellectual 
property, loss or theft of customer data, and could result in 
violations of applicable privacy laws.
4.3.8  CBA may be adversely 
affected by human capital 
risk
CBAs ability to attract and retain qualified and skilled 
executives, employees and Board members is an 
important factor in achieving the strategic objectives 
of the CBA Group. The Chief Executive Officer, the 
management team of the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Board have skills that are critical to setting the strategic 
direction, successful management and growth of CBA, 
and whose loss due to resignation, retirement, death or 
illness may adversely affect CBAs business, operations 
and financial condition. 
If CBA has difficulty retaining or attracting highly qualified 
people for important roles, including key executives and 
Board members, particularly in times of strategic change, 
CBAs business, operations and financial condition could 
be adversely affected.
4.3.9  CBA could suffer losses due 
to climate change
Climate change is systemic in nature, and is a significant 
long-term driver of both financial and non-financial 
risks. A failure to respond to the potential and expected 
impacts of climate change will affect CBAs long-term 
performance and can be expected to have group-wide 
impacts for the CBA Group in its lending (retail and 
business), procurement and investment portfolios. These 
include, but are not limited to, impacts on the probability 
of default and losses arising from defaults, valuations and 
collateral as well as portfolio performance.
CBA recognises that inadequate assessment and 
management of the physical risk (arising from extreme 
weather events and longer-term shifts in climate patterns) 
and transition risk (arising from legal, market, regulatory, 
technology and reputational changes associated with a 
transition to a low carbon economy) of climate change, 
have the potential to disrupt business activities, damage 
property and otherwise affect the value of assets, and 
affect our customers ability to repay loans. 
Climate change therefore has the potential to impact the 
CBA Groups franchise value, strategic risk and financial 
risk and poses a risk to CBAs cost of capital.
4.3.10  CBA is subject to compliance 
risks, which could adversely 
impact its future results and 
reputation
Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, 
material financial loss, or loss of reputation that CBA may 
suffer as a result of its failure to comply, or perceived 
failure to comply, with the requirements of relevant laws, 
regulatory bodies, industry standards and codes. Increasing 
volume, complexity and global reach of such requirements, 
and the increased propensity for sanctions and the level 
of financial penalties for breaches of requirements, could 
adversely impact on CBAs results and reputation.

Section 4
This includes for example, financial crime related 
obligations such as anti-money laundering and counter-
terrorism financing laws, anti-bribery and corruption laws 
and economic and trade sanctions laws in the jurisdictions 
in which it operates. The number and wide reach of these 
obligations, combined with the increasing global focus on 
compliance with and enforcement of these obligations, 
presents a risk of adverse impacts on CBA, including to its 
reputation.
Compliance risk may also arise where CBA interprets its 
obligations differently from regulators or a court.
4.3.11  CBAs business could be 
negatively impacted by 
substantial legal liability or 
regulatory action 
Due to the nature of CBAs business, it is involved 
in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, 
principally in Australia and New Zealand. Such matters 
are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of 
individual matters cannot be predicted with certainty. If 
CBA is ordered to pay money (for example, damages, 
fines, penalties or legal costs), has orders made against its 
assets (for example, a charging order or writ of execution), 
is ordered to carry out actions which adversely affect its 
business operations or reputation (for example, corrective 
advertising) or is otherwise subject to adverse outcomes 
of litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, CBAs 
business, financial condition, operations, prospects and 
reputation may be adversely affected. 
Examples of litigation and regulatory investigations 
include the shareholder class actions and an ASIC 
investigation both of which relate to the subject matter of 
the proceedings that were commenced against CBA by 
AUSTRAC (which have now been resolved), the class action 
proceedings concerning investment in cash and deposit 
options against Colonial First State Investments and CBA 
and the proceedings brought by the Commonwealth 
Director of Public Prosecutions against CommInsure Life 
for alleged contraventions of the anti-hawking provisions of 
the Corporations Act, as announced by CBA on 4 October 
2019. 
4.3.12  CBA may incur losses as a 
result of the inappropriate 
conduct of its staff
CBA could be adversely affected if an employee, 
contractor or external service provider does not act 
in accordance with regulations or CBAs policies and 
procedures, engages in inappropriate or fraudulent 
conduct, or unintentionally fails to meet a professional 
obligation to specific clients. Examples are inadequate 
or defective financial advice, product defects and 
unsuitability, market manipulation, insider trading, privacy 
or data security breaches and misleading or deceptive 
conduct in advertising. As a result, CBA could incur losses, 
financial penalties and reputational damage, and could be 
subject to legal or regulatory action. 
4.3.13  CBA may incur losses 
associated with 
counterparty exposures
CBA assumes counterparty risk in connection with 
its lending, trading, derivatives, insurance and other 
businesses as it relies on the ability of its counterparties 
to satisfy their financial obligations to the Issuer on a 
timely basis. For example, customers may default on their 
home, personal and business loans, and trades may fail to 
settle due to non-payment by a counterparty or a systems 
failure by clearing agents, exchanges, or other financial 
intermediaries. This risk also arises from CBAs exposure to 
lenders mortgage insurance and re-insurance providers. 
There is also a risk that CBAs rights against counterparties 
may not be enforceable in certain circumstances.
Counterparties may default on their obligations due to 
insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other 
reasons. This risk may be increased by a deterioration 
in economic conditions and a sustained high level 
of unemployment. In assessing whether to extend 
credit or enter into other transactions, CBA relies on 
counterparties providing information that is accurate and 
not misleading, including financial statements and other 
financial information. CBAs financial performance could 
be negatively impacted to the extent that it relies on 
information that is inaccurate or materially misleading.
Unexpected credit losses could have a significant adverse 
effect on CBAs business, financial condition, operations 
and prospects.
4.3.14  CBAs results may be 
adversely affected by 
liquidity and funding risks
CBA is subject to liquidity and funding risks, which could 
adversely impact its future results. Liquidity risk is the risk 
of being unable to meet financial obligations as and when 
they fall due. Funding risk is the risk of over-reliance on a 
funding source to the extent that a change or increased 
competition in that funding source could increase overall 
funding costs or cause difficulty in raising funds. 
Further information on liquidity and funding risk 
is outlined in the following sub-sections and is 
also included in the 2019 Annual Report. The 2019 
AnnualReport is available from the Investor Centre 
at www.commbank.com.au/annual-reports. 
(i) Adverse financial and credit market conditions 
may significantly affect CBAs ability to access 
international debt markets, on which it relies for a 
substantial amount of its wholesale funding
While the majority of CBAs funding comes from 
deposits, it remains reliant on offshore wholesale 
funding markets to source a significant amount of its 
funding and grow its business. 
Global market volatility may adversely impact the cost 
and CBAs ability to access wholesale funding markets, 
and may also result in increased competition for, and 
therefore the cost of deposits in Australia.

PERLS XII Prospectus
If CBA is unable to pass its increased funding costs 
on to its customers, CBAs financial performance will 
decline due to lower net interest margins. If CBA is 
forced to seek alternative sources of funding, the 
availability of such alternative funding and the terms 
on which it may be available will depend on a variety 
of factors, including prevailing financial and credit 
market conditions. Even if available, the cost of these 
alternatives may be more expensive or they may 
only be available on unfavourable terms, which may 
adversely impact CBAs cost of borrowing and CBAs 
on-going operations and funding. If CBA is unable to 
source appropriate and timely funding, it may also be 
forced to reduce its lending or consider selling assets.
(ii) CBA may not be able to maintain adequate levels 
of liquidity and funding, which would adversely 
affect CBAs business, financial condition, 
operations and prospects
CBAs liquidity and funding policies are designed to 
ensure that it will meet its debts and other obligations as 
and when they fall due. Although CBA actively monitors 
and manages its liquidity and funding positions, there 
are factors outside CBAs control which could adversely 
affect these positions, for example, if financial markets 
are closed for an extended period of time, or if a change 
in customer behaviour driven by low, zero or negative 
interest rates leads to an outflow of deposits.
In addition to APRAs LCR requirements (effective 
1 January 2015), CBA must comply with the 
NSFR requirements, which came into effect from 
1 January 2018. If CBA fails to maintain adequate levels 
of liquidity and funding, it would adversely affect CBAs 
business, financial condition, operations and prospects.
(iii) Failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely 
affect CBAs cost of funds, liquidity, access to debt 
and capital markets and competitive position
CBAs credit ratings (which are strongly influenced by 
Australias sovereign credit rating) affect the cost and 
availability of its funding from debt and other funding 
sources. Credit ratings could be used by potential 
customers, lenders and investors in deciding whether 
to transact with or invest in CBA. 
A downgrade to CBAs credit ratings, or Australias 
sovereign credit rating, could adversely affect 
CBAs cost of funds, liquidity, access to debt and 
capital markets, collateralisation requirements and 
competitive position. 
Some ratings agencies also assign ratings to 
regulatory capital securities (such as PERLS XII) 
for use by wholesale investors and may announce 
changes to their rating methodology and/or to the 
securities ratings, either during the Offer Period or 
after PERLS XII has been issued.
4.3.15  CBA may be adversely 
affected by capital adequacy 
risk
CBA must satisfy substantial capital requirements, subject 
to qualitative and quantitative review and assessment by 
its regulators. Regulatory capital requirements influence 
how CBA uses its capital, and can restrict its ability to pay 
dividends and Additional Tier 1 distributions, or to make 
stock repurchases. CBAs capital ratios may be affected 
by a number of factors, including earnings, asset growth, 
changes in the value of the Australian dollar against 
other currencies in which CBA conducts its business, 
and changes in business strategy (including acquisitions, 
divestments, investments and changes in capital intensive 
businesses).
CBA operates an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) to manage its capital levels and to 
maintain them above the minimum levels approved by 
the Board (which are currently set to exceed regulatory 
requirements). The ICAAP includes forecasting and stress 
testing of capital levels, which guide CBA in selecting any 
capital management initiatives it may undertake. 
Should the ICAAP forecasts or stress tests prove to be 
ineffective, CBA may not be holding sufficient capital 
and may need to raise capital to manage balance sheet 
growth and/or extreme stress.
4.3.16  CBA may be adversely 
affected by market risks, 
including interest rates and 
exchange rates
CBA is exposed to market risks, including the potential 
for losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
(including potential for negative interest rates), foreign 
exchange rates, commodity and equity prices, credit 
spreads and implied volatility levels for assets and 
liabilities where options are transacted. This exposure 
is split between traded market risks, primarily through 
providing services to customers on a global basis, and 
non-traded market risks, predominantly interest rate risk 
in the banking book.
Changes in market factors such as potential 
developments or future changes in the administration of 
financial benchmark interest rates could result in adverse 
consequences to the return on, value of and market 
for, securities and other instruments whose returns are 
linked to any such benchmark, including those securities 
or other instruments issued by the CBA Group. If the 
CBA Group was to suffer substantial losses due to any 
market volatility, it may adversely affect the CBA Groups 
financial performance or financial condition.
Additionally, a significant proportion of CBAs wholesale 
funding and some of its profits and investments are in 
currencies other than the Australian dollar, principally the 
U.S. dollar and the Euro. This exposes CBA to exchange 
rate risk on these activities, as its functional and financial 
reporting currency is the Australian dollar. These activities 
are hedged where appropriate, however there are also 
risks associated with hedging, for example, a hedge 
counterparty may default on its obligations to CBA.

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes (continued)
Section 4
For a description of these specific risks, see note 9.3 to 
CBAs audited consolidated and non-consolidated annual 
financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 
2019. There can be no assurance that CBAs exchange rate 
hedging arrangements or hedging policy will be sufficient 
or effective. CBAs results of operations may be adversely 
affected if its hedges are not effective to mitigate 
exchange rate risks, if CBA is inappropriately hedged or if 
a hedge provider defaults on its obligations under CBAs 
hedging agreements.
4.3.17  CBAs results could be 
adversely impacted by 
strategic risks
Strategic risk is the risk of material value destruction or 
less than planned value creation, due to changes in CBAs 
external and internal operating environment. Examples of 
strategic risk include:
 
suboptimal allocation and balance of CBAs resources 
to execute on its strategic objectives;
 
ineffective delivery of CBAs strategy (for example due 
to operational complexity or the pace of execution 
being too fast for processes, people and systems to 
work as they need to, or too slow to keep pace with 
the changing environment); and
 
the inability of CBA to keep pace with intensified 
competition from traditional and non-traditional 
financial services players across key value pools.
While the Board regularly monitors and discusses 
CBAs operating environment, strategic objectives and 
implementation of major strategic initiatives, there can be 
no assurance that such objectives and initiatives will be 
successful or that they will not adversely impact CBA.
4.3.18  CBAs performance and 
financial position may 
be adversely affected by 
acquisitions or divestments 
of businesses 
CBA is currently undertaking a number of divestments 
and strategic reviews of certain businesses, as outlined 
in Section 3.2 Businesses of CBA. CBA may further 
continue to divest businesses or capabilities it considers 
non-core or wind down businesses or product areas.
There is a risk that the cost and pace of executing 
divestments, including as a result of external approvals, 
may cause CBA to experience disruptions in the 
divestment, transition or wind down process, including 
to existing businesses, which may cause customers to 
remove their business from CBA or have other adverse 
impacts to CBA. 
From time to time, CBA evaluates and undertakes 
acquisitions of other businesses. There is a risk that 
CBA may not achieve the expected synergies from the 
acquisition, and may experience disruptions to its existing 
businesses due to difficulties in integrating the systems 
and processes of the acquired business. These may 
cause CBA to lose customers and market share, and incur 
financial losses. 
Multiple divestments and/or acquisitions at the same 
time may exacerbate these risks.
4.3.19  CBA could be adversely 
impacted by investor 
activism
CBA has in the past, and may in the future, be challenged 
on its strategy by shareholders, including institutional 
shareholders, and special interest groups. Areas which 
have attracted investor activism in Australia include 
making socially responsible investment and avoiding 
financing or interacting with businesses that do not 
demonstrate responsible management of environmental 
and social issues. The prevalence of investor activism 
could impact managements decision-making and 
implementation of CBAs initiatives, which in turn could 
adversely affect its financial results.
4.3.20  CBA may be adversely 
impacted by insurance risk
Events that the CBA Group has provided insurance 
against may occur more frequently or with greater 
severity than anticipated, which could adversely impact 
CBA. In the life insurance business, this risk arises 
primarily through mortality (death) and morbidity (illness 
and injury) related claims being greater than expected. In 
the general insurance business, this risk is mainly driven 
by weather related incidents (such as storms, floods or 
bushfires) and other catastrophes.

 Summary of Australian tax 
consequences for Holders
5.4.1 Introduction
The following is a summary of the Australian tax 
consequences for certain Australian resident Holders and 
non-Australian resident Holders who subscribe for  
PERLS XII under the Offer.
This summary is not exhaustive and you should seek 
advice from your financial or other professional adviser 
before deciding to invest in PERLS XII. In particular, 
this summary does not consider the consequences for 
Holders who:
 
acquire	PERLS	XII	otherwise	than	under	the	Offer;	
 
hold PERLS XII in their business of share trading, 
dealing in securities or otherwise hold their PERLS XII 
on	revenue	account	or	as	trading	stock;
 
are subject to the taxation of financial arrangements 
provisions in Division 230 of the Tax Act in relation to 
their	Holding	of	PERLS	XII;	and/or
 
in relation to a non-Australian resident, hold their 
PERLS XII through a permanent establishment 
inAustralia.
This summary is not intended to be, nor should it be 
construed as being, investment, legal or tax advice to any 
particular Holder.
This summary is based on Australian tax laws 
and regulations, interpretations of such laws and 
regulations, and administrative practice as at the date 
ofthisProspectus.
5.4.2  Class ruling sought on 
PERLS XII
CBA has applied to the ATO for a public class ruling 
confirming certain Australian income tax consequences 
for Australian resident Holders. In accordance with usual 
practice, a class ruling will only be issued after the public 
announcement of a transaction and will not become 
operative until it is published in the Government Gazette.
When issued, copies of the class ruling will be available 
from www.ato.gov.au and from the Investor Centre at 
https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/investors/other-
securities.
For personal use only
65
PERLS XII Prospectus
It is expected that, when issued, the class ruling will:
 
only be binding on the Commissioner of Taxation 
if the Offer is carried out in the specific manner 
described	in	the	class	ruling;
 
only apply to Australian resident Holders that are 
within the class of entities specified in the class 
ruling, which is expected to be Australian resident 
Holders who acquire their PERLS XII through the Offer 
and hold them on capital account for tax purposes. 
Therefore, the class ruling will not apply to Australian 
resident Holders who hold their PERLS XII as trading 
stock	or	on	revenue	account;
 
only rule on taxation laws applicable as at the date the 
class	ruling	is	issued;
 
not consider the tax consequences of an early 
Exchange	or	Resale;
 
not consider the taxation treatment of Distributions 
received	by	partnerships	or	trustee	investors;	and
 
not consider the tax consequences for Australian 
resident Holders for whom gains and losses from 
PERLS XII are subject to the taxation of financial 
arrangements provisions in Division 230 of the Tax 
Act. It is noted that Division 230 will generally not 
apply to the financial arrangements of individuals, 
unless an election has been made for those rules 
toapply.
Class rulings are split into parts being (i) the ruling section 
where the Commissioner of Taxation provides a binding 
ruling on the application of the law and (ii) non-binding 
sections.
There is one issue that will only be addressed in a non-
binding section of the ruling. The issue relates to a rule 
which applies when the issuer of the instrument (here, 
CBA) is entitled to a deduction in a foreign jurisdiction 
in relation to distributions paid on the instrument. It is 
possible that this rule could apply to Distributions paid 
on PERLS XII as a result of the manner in which CBAs 
offshore branches are required to calculate taxable 
income in foreign jurisdictions. The Commissioner of 
Taxation is aware of the potential application of this rule 
and, subject to CBA entering into a deed, has agreed 
to use his general administrative powers to not deny 
Holders the benefit of either franking credits or tax offsets 
in relation to the Distributions. As the Commissioner of 
Taxation is providing this confirmation under his general 
administrative powers, it will be provided in a non-binding 
section of the class ruling. CBA will enter into a deed 
with the Commissioner of Taxation and will provide 
undertakings in relation to the potential application 
of this rule. The deed, and compliance by CBA with its 
undertakings under the deed, will not have any negative 
impact on Holders.
5.4.3 Distributions on PERLS XII
PERLS XII should be characterised as non-share equity 
interests for Australian income tax purposes.
5.4.3.1 Australian resident Holders
Distributions should be treated as non-share dividends 
that are frankable.
Generally, provided that a Holder is a qualified person 
and the ATO does not make a determination under 
the dividend streaming rules to deny the benefit of the 
franking credits to the Holder, the Holder:
 
should include the amount of the Distribution as well 
as an amount equal to the franking credits attached 
to the Distribution in their assessable income in the 
income	year	in	which	they	received	the	Distribution;	
and
 
should qualify for a tax offset equal to the franking 
credits attached to the Distribution which can be 
applied against their income tax liability for the 
relevant income year.
A Holder that is an individual or complying 
superannuation	fund	may	be	able	to	receive	a	cashtax	
refund	from	the	ATO	if	the	tax	offset	equal	to	thefranking	
credits attached to the Distribution exceeds the tax 
payable on the Holders total taxable income. A Holder 
that is a company will not be entitled to a tax refund 
of the excess franking credits. Rather, the surplus 
franking credits may be converted to a tax loss which 
can be carried forward to future years (subject to the 
Holdersatisfying	certain	loss	carry	forward	rules).
A Holder should be a qualified person if the holding 
period rule and the related payments rule are 
satisfied.Generally:
 
to satisfy the holding period rule, a Holder must 
have held their PERLS XII at risk for a continuous 
period of at least 90 days (excluding the day of 
disposal) within a period beginning on the day 
afterthe	day	on	which	they	are	acquired	and	ending	
on the 90th day after they become ex-distribution. To 
be held at risk, a Holder must retain 30% or more 
of the risks and benefits associated with holding 
their PERLS XII. Where a Holder undertakes risk 
management strategies in relation to their PERLS XII 
(e.g. by the use of limited recourse loans, options or 
other derivatives), the Holders ability to satisfy the at 
risk requirement of the holding period rule may be 
affected;	and	
 
under the related payments rule, a Holder who is 
obliged to make a related payment (essentially a 
payment passing on the benefit of the Distribution) 
in respect of a Distribution must hold the PERLS XII 
at risk for at least 90 days (not including the days of 
acquisition and disposal) within each period beginning 
90 days before, and ending 90 days after, they 
become ex-distribution.
A Holder who is an individual is automatically treated 
as a qualified person for these purposes if the total 
amount of the tax offsets in respect of all franked 
amounts to which the Holder is entitled in an income 
year does not exceed A$5,000. This is referred to as the 
small shareholder rule. However, a Holder will not be 
a qualified person under the small shareholder rule if 
related payments have been made, or will be made, in 
respect of such amounts.

Section 5
There are anti-avoidance rules which can deny the benefit 
of franking credits to Holders in certain situations. 
One such rule (in section 207-158 of the Tax Act) applies 
when the issuer of the instrument (here, CBA) is entitled 
to a deduction in a foreign jurisdiction in relation to 
distributions paid on the instrument. It is possible that 
this rule could apply to Distributions paid on PERLS XII 
as a result of how CBAs offshore branches are required 
to calculate taxable income in foreign jurisdictions. The 
Commissioner of Taxation is aware of this issue and, 
subject to CBA entering into a deed, has agreed to use 
his general administrative powers to not deny Holders the 
benefit of either franking credits or tax offsets in relation 
to Distributions. The Commissioner of Taxation will 
confirm this position in the PERLS XII class ruling. CBA 
will enter into a deed with the Commissioner of Taxation 
and will provide undertakings in relation to the potential 
application of section 207-158.
Of the other anti-avoidance rules, the most significant is 
in section 177EA of the Tax Act. The High Court in Andrew 
Vincent Mills v FCT [2012]	HCA51	(Mills) considered the 
operation	of	section	177EAin	the	context	of	the	PERLS	V	
securities issued by CBA on 14 October 2009. The High 
Court unanimously held that section 177EA did not apply 
in	respect	of	frankable	distributions	paid	on	the	PERLS	V	
securities. 
In light of the decision in Mills, and having regard to 
the ATOs current practices, neither section 177EA, nor 
other anti-avoidance rules, should apply to Distributions 
on PERLS XII, subject to the particular circumstances 
ofaHolder.	
5.4.3.2 Non-Australian resident Holders
Distributions should not be subject to Australian  
non-resident withholding tax to the extent the 
Distributions are franked. 
To the extent an unfranked Distribution is paid to 
non-Australian resident Holders, withholding tax will be 
payable. The rate of withholding tax is 30%. However, 
non-Australian resident Holders may be entitled to 
a reduction in the rate of withholding tax if they are 
resident in a country which has a double taxation 
agreement	withAustralia.
5.4.4 Disposal of PERLS XII
5.4.4.1 Disposal other than through Exchange
(a) Australian resident Holders
On the disposal (including on-market disposal, 
Redemption or Resale) of PERLS XII, Australian resident 
Holders will be required to include any gain in their 
assessable income in the income tax year in which the 
disposal occurs. The gain will generally be equal to the 
proceeds from the disposal less the cost of acquisition for 
their PERLS XII. 
As PERLS XII are not traditional securities, 
qualifying Holders (individuals, trusts and complying 
superannuation funds) who have held their PERLS XII for 
at least 12 months prior to disposal may be eligible for 
theCGT	discount	concession	on	any	capital	gain	made	
ondisposal.
The Federal Government has announced that managed 
investment trusts (MITs) and attribution MITs 
(AMITs) will no longer be entitled to the CGT discount 
at the trust level from 1 July 2020. MITs and AMITs that 
derive capital gains will continue to be able to distribute 
those amounts as capital gains that may be subject to the 
CGT discount in the hands of those beneficiaries who are 
entitled to the CGT discount. 
Any loss on the disposal (including an on-market disposal) 
of PERLS XII should give rise to a capital loss for Holders 
under the CGT rules in the Tax Act. Capital losses are 
generally only deductible against capital gains, but can 
becarried	forward	for	use	in	a	later	year.	
If an Australian resident Holder realises a loss from 
an off-market disposal of PERLS XII, they should seek 
their own advice as to whether a loss is allowed in their 
circumstances.  
(b) Non-Australian resident Holders
As PERLS XII are not traditional securities,  
non-Australian resident Holders should generally not 
be taxable on any gain realised on disposal of their 
PERLS XII (as PERLS XII should generally not be taxable 
Australianproperty).	
5.4.4.2 Disposal through Exchange
Under specific provisions of the Tax Act, any gain or loss 
that would arise on Exchange should be disregarded. The 
consequence of this is that the gain or loss is effectively 
deferred, with a Holders cost base in the Ordinary Shares 
acquired on Exchange reflecting the Holders cost base in 
their PERLS XII. This outcome applies both to Australian 
resident Holders and non-Australian resident Holders. 
5.4.5  Ordinary Shares acquired on 
Exchange
5.4.5.1 Australian resident Holders
The taxation treatment of any dividends received on 
Ordinary Shares acquired on Exchange will be broadly 
similar to that discussed in Section 5.4.3.1 Australian 
resident Holders.
The Ordinary Shares will not be traditional securities. 
As such, any gain or loss realised on disposal should be 
taxable under the CGT provisions. For CGT purposes, the 
Ordinary Shares acquired on Exchange will be taken to 
have been acquired on the Exchange Date. This means 
that the Ordinary Shares would need to be held for at 
least 12 months after the Exchange Date in order for 
qualifying Holders (individuals, trusts and complying 
superannuation funds) to be eligible for the CGT discount 
concession on a subsequent disposal. 
5.4.5.2 Non-Australian resident Holders
The tax treatment of any dividends received on Ordinary 
Shares will be broadly similar to that discussed in  
Section 5.4.3.2 Non-Australian resident Holders.
Non-Australian resident Holders should generally not be 
taxable on any gain realised on disposal of their Ordinary 
Shares (as the Ordinary Shares should generally not be 
taxable Australian property).

PERLS XII Prospectus
5.4.6  Provision of TFN and/or ABN
The Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) imposes 
withholding tax (currently at the rate of 47%) on the 
payment of distributions on certain types of investments 
such as the unfranked part (if any) of Distributions. 
However, where a Holder has provided CBA with their 
TFN or, in certain circumstances, their ABN, or has 
notified CBA that they are exempt from providing this 
information, CBA is not required to withhold any amount 
on account of tax from payments.
A Holder is not required to provide their TFN or ABN to 
CBA.
5.4.7 GST
GST is not payable on the issue, receipt, disposal, 
Exchange, Redemption or Resale of PERLS XII.
GST is not payable in relation to the payment of 
Distributions,	or	repayment	of	the	Face	Value,	by	CBA.
5.4.8 Stamp duty
No stamp duty should be payable on the issue, receipt, 
disposal, Exchange, Redemption or Resale of PERLS XII.

notes of CBA, issued in registered form by entry in the

and independent obligation which CBA owes to 
the relevant Holder, which that Holder may enforce 
without joining any other Holder or any previous

each PERLS XII for its Face Value in accordance with 
this clause.
(b) Holders do not have any right to prove in a winding 
up of CBA in respect of PERLS XII, other than a right to 
prove in a winding up of CBA in Australia as permitted 
under clauses 1.5(c) and 1.5(d).

CBA in Australia:
(i) after the claims of all holders of Senior Ranking

(ii) equally with each Holder and holders of Equal

(iii) ahead of holders of Junior Ranking Securities.
(d) In order to give effect to the ranking specified in 
clause 1.5(c), in any winding up of CBA in Australia, the

payment in full before any payment is made to 
Holders; and
(ii) Holders of PERLS XII and holders of any Equal

Distribution Rate determination
The Distribution Rate (expressed as a percentage per

according to the following formula:
Distribution Rate =
(Market Rate + Margin) x (1  Tax Rate)
where:
Market Rate means 
(a) subject to paragraph (b), the Bank Bill Swap Reference 
Rate administered by ASX Benchmarks Pty Limited 
(or any other person that takes on the administration 
of that rate) expressed as a percentage per annum for 
a term of 3 months as displayed on the BBSW page 
published through information vendors (or any page 
that replaces that page) on the first Business Day of 
the Distribution Period, provided that where PERLS XII 
are Resold, Exchanged or Redeemed on a day which 
is not a scheduled Distribution Payment Date, and a 
Distribution is payable, then the Market Rate for the 
Distribution Period commencing on the Resale Date, 
Exchange Date or Redemption Date (as applicable) in 
respect of such PERLS XII shall be the Market Rate for 
the Distribution Period preceding the relevant Resale 
Date, Exchange Date, or Redemption Date; and
(b) if CBA determines that a Market Rate Disruption Event 
has occurred, then, CBA shall: 
(i) use as the Market Rate such Alternative Market 
Rate as it may determine; and
(ii) make such adjustments to the Terms as it 
determines to be reasonably necessary to calculate 
Distributions in accordance with such Alternative 
Market Rate;
provided that APRA's prior written approval will be 
required in respect of any such adjustment arising 
from an event that is specified in paragraph (iii) or (iv) 
of the definition of "Market Rate Disruption Event" in 
clause 2.2(d); and
(c) in making the above determinations in paragraph (b), 
CBA:
(i) shall act in good faith and in a commercially 
reasonable manner; 
(ii) may consult such sources of market practice as it 
considers appropriate; and 
(iii) may otherwise make such determination in its 
discretion. 
(d) For the purposes of this clause:
Market Rate Disruption Event occurs when, in 
CBA's opinion, the Market Rate in paragraph (a) of the 
definition:
(i) is not published by 10:30am or such other time 
that CBA considers appropriate on that day; 
(ii) is published but is affected by an obvious error; 
(iii) has been discontinued or otherwise ceased to be 
calculated or administered; or  
(iv) is no longer generally accepted in the Australian 
market as a reference rate appropriate to floating 
rate debt securities of a tenor and interest period 
comparable to that of PERLS XII. 
Alternative Market Rate means a rate other than 
the rate described in paragraph (a) of the definition 
of Market Rate, that is, in CBA's opinion, generally 
accepted in the Australian market as the successor to 
the Market Rate, or if there is no such rate: 
(a) a reference rate that is, in CBA's opinion, 
appropriate to floating rate debt securities of a 
tenor and interest period most comparable to 
PERLS XII; or
(b) such other reference rate as CBA considers 
appropriate having regard to available comparable 
indices; and 
provided that, CBA reserves the discretion to 
incorporate an adjustment (which may be positive 
or negative) or a formula or methodology for 
calculating such an adjustment in order to reduce or 
eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit to 
Holders as a result of the use of an Alternative Market 
Rate. APRAs prior written approval will be required 
in respect of the Alternative Market Rate or any such 
adjustment arising from an event that is specified in 
paragraph (iii) or (iv) of the definition of "Market Rate 
Disruption Event" in this clause.
Margin means the rate (expressed as a percentage per 
annum) determined under the Bookbuild; and

Distribution 
payable

of days in that Distribution Period.
2.4

convert or write down (in the case of any other 
Relevant Securities) on a pro-rata basis or in a 
manner that is otherwise, in the opinion of CBA, 
fair and reasonable, PERLS XII and any Relevant 
Securities whose terms require or permit, or are 
taken by law to require or permit, them to be 
Exchanged, converted or written down in that 
manner (subject to such adjustment as CBA 
may determine to take into account the effect 
on marketable parcels and whole numbers of 
Ordinary Shares and any PERLS XII or other 
Relevant Securities remaining on issue),
but such determination will not impede the 
immediate Exchange of the relevant number of 
PERLS XII or percentage of the Face Value of each 
PERLS XII (as the case may be).
(d) For the purposes of clauses 4.1(b) and 4.1(c), where 
the specified currency of the face value of Relevant 
Securities and/or PERLS XII is not the same, CBA may 
treat them as if converted into a single currency of 
CBAs choice at such rate of exchange as CBA in good 
faith considers reasonable.
(e) If a Capital Trigger Event occurs:
(i) the relevant number of PERLS XII, or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII, must be 
Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of the 
Capital Trigger Event in accordance with clauses 
4.5 and 7 and the Exchange will be irrevocable;
(ii) CBA must give notice as soon as practicable that 
Exchange has occurred to ASX and the Holders; 
(iii) the notice must specify the date on which the 
Capital Trigger Event occurred; and
(iv) the notice must specify the details of the Exchange 
process, including any details which were taken 
into account in relation to the effect on marketable 
parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, 
and the impact on any PERLS XII remaining on 
issue.
Failure to undertake any of the steps in clauses 4.1(e)
(ii) to (iv) does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise 
impede Exchange.
4.2 
Non-Viability Trigger Event
(a) A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA 
notifies CBA in writing that it believes:
(i) Exchange of all or some PERLS XII, or exchange, 
conversion or write down of capital instruments of 
the CBA Group, is necessary because, without it, 
CBA would become non-viable; or
(ii) a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, CBA 
would become non-viable.
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital 
instruments which must be Exchanged, converted or 
written down (as applicable).

Appendix A
(b) If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, CBA must 
Exchange such number of PERLS XII (or, if it so 
determines, such percentage of the Face Value of 
each PERLS XII) as is equal (taking into account any 
exchange, conversion or write down of Relevant 
Securities as referred to in paragraph (c) below) 
to the aggregate face value of capital instruments 
which APRA has notified CBA must be Exchanged, 
converted or written down (or, if APRA has not so 
notified CBA, such number or, if CBA so determines, 
such percentage of the Face Value of each PERLSXII, 
as is necessary to satisfy APRA that CBA will no 
longer be non-viable). If a Non-Viability Trigger Event 
occurs under clause 4.2(a)(ii), CBA must Exchange all 
PERLSXII.
(c) In determining the number of PERLS XII, or 
percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII, which 
must be Exchanged in accordance with this clause, 
CBA will:
(i) firstly, exchange, convert or write down the face 
value of any Relevant Securities whose terms 
require or permit, or are taken by law to require 
or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or 
written down before Exchange of PERLS XII; and
(ii) secondly, if exchange, conversion or write down 
of those securities is not sufficient, Exchange 
(in the case of PERLS XII) or exchange, convert 
or write down (in the case of any other Relevant 
Securities), on a pro-rata basis or in a manner 
that is otherwise, in the opinion of CBA, fair and 
reasonable, PERLS XII and any Relevant Securities 
whose terms require or permit, or are taken by 
law to require or permit, them to be Exchanged, 
converted or written down in that manner (subject 
to such adjustments as CBA may determine to 
take into account the effect on marketable parcels 
and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares and any 
PERLS XII or other Relevant Securities remaining 
on issue),
but such determination will not impede the 
immediate Exchange of the relevant number of PERLS 
XII or percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII 
(as the case may be).
(d) For the purposes of clauses 4.2(b) and 4.2(c), where 
the specified currency of the face value of Relevant 
Securities and/or PERLS XII is not the same, CBA may 
treat them as if converted into a single currency of 
CBAs choice at such rate of exchange as CBA in good 
faith considers reasonable.
(e) If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs:
(i) the relevant number of PERLS XII, or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII, must be 
Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of 
the Non-Viability Trigger Event in accordance 
with clauses 4.5 and 7 and the Exchange will be 
irrevocable;
(ii) CBA must give notice as soon as practicable that 
Exchange has occurred to ASX and the Holders;
(iii) the notice must specify the date on which the 
Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred; and
(iv) the notice must specify the details of the Exchange 
process, including any details which were taken 
into account in relation to the effect on marketable 
parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, and 
the impact on any PERLS XII remaining on issue.
Failure to undertake any of the steps in clauses 4.2(e)
(ii) to (iv) does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise 
impede Exchange.
4.3 
 Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not 
apply to Capital Trigger Event or Non-
Viability Trigger Event 
For the avoidance of doubt, the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions do not apply to Exchange as a result of a 
Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
occurring.
4.4 
Priority of Early Exchange Obligations 
An Exchange required because of a Capital Trigger 
Event or a Non-Viability Trigger Event takes place 
notwithstanding anything in clause 3.
4.5 
 Automatic Exchange upon the 
occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event 
or Non-Viability Trigger Event
If a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
has occurred and all or some PERLS XII (or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII) are required to be 
Exchanged in accordance with clauses 4.1 or 4.2, then: 
(a) Exchange of the relevant PERLS XII or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII will occur in 
accordance with clause 7 immediately upon the date 
of occurrence of the Capital Trigger Event or Non-
Viability Trigger Event; and
(b) the entry of the corresponding PERLS XII in each 
relevant Holders holding in the Register will constitute 
an entitlement of that Holder to the relevant 
number of Ordinary Shares (and, if applicable, also 
to any remaining balance of PERLS XII or remaining 
percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII), and 
CBA will recognise the Holder as having been issued 
the relevant Ordinary Shares for all purposes,
in each case without the need for any further act or step 
by CBA, the Holder or any other person (and CBA will, as 
soon as possible thereafter and without delay on the part 
of CBA, take any appropriate procedural steps to record 
such Exchange, including updating the Register and the 
Ordinary Share register and seek quotation of Ordinary 
Shares issued on Exchange). 
For the avoidance of doubt:
(c) nothing in this clause allows a payment to be made to 
a Holder upon Exchange; and
(d) Exchange under this clause takes priority over a notice 
for Redemption issued under clauses 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4.

4.6 
 No further rights if Exchange cannot 
occur
If, for any reason, Exchange of any PERLS XII (or a 
percentage of the Face Value of any PERLS XII) required 
to be Exchanged under clauses 4.1 or 4.2 fails to take 
effect under clauses 4.5(a) and 4.5(b) and CBA has not 
otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be 
issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business 
Days after the date of the occurrence of the Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the 
relevant Holders rights (including to payment of the Face 
Value and Distributions, and the right to receive Ordinary 
Shares) in relation to such PERLS XII or percentage of the 
Face Value of PERLS XII are immediately and irrevocably 
terminated and such termination will be taken to have 
occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of 
the Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
CBA must give notice as soon as practicable that such 
termination has occurred to the Holders and such notice 
must be announced on ASX, and the notice must specify 
the date on which the Capital Trigger Event or Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurred.
4.7 
Change of Control Event 
(a) A Change of Control Event occurs when:
(i) a takeover bid is made for Ordinary Shares 
(A) acceptance of which is recommended by the 
Board and which is or has become unconditional or 
(B) which is or has become unconditional and the 
voting power of the offeror in CBA is or has become 
greater than 50%; or 
(ii) in respect of a scheme of arrangement under 
Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act which would 
result (if implemented) in a person having voting 
power in more than 50% of CBA, the earlier of 
(A) a court approving the scheme, and (B) the 
Board determining that such event should be 
treated as a Change of Control Event for the 
purposes of this clause,
provided that clause 4.7(a)(ii) does not include a 
scheme of arrangement which would result in a NOHC 
Event.
(b) If a Change of Control Event occurs, then:
(i) CBA must Exchange all (but not some) PERLS XII;
(ii) CBA must give notice as soon as practicable and in 
any event within 10 Business Days after becoming 
aware of that event occurring to ASX and the 
Holders; 
(iii) the notice must specify a date on which it 
is proposed Exchange will occur (proposed 
Exchange Date) being:
(1) in the case of a Change of Control Event under 
clause 4.7(a)(i), no later than the Business Day 
prior to the then announced closing date of the 
relevant takeover bid; 
(2) in the case of a Change of Control Event under 
clause 4.7(a)(ii)(A), a date no later than the 
record date for participation in the relevant 
scheme of arrangement; or
(3) in the case of a Change of Control Event under 
clause 4.7(a)(ii)(B), a date no later than 25 
Business Days following the date the notice is 
given, or the record date for participation in the 
relevant scheme of arrangement, whichever is 
earlier; and
(iv) the notice must specify the details of the Exchange 
process including any details to take into account 
the effect on marketable parcels and whole 
numbers of Ordinary Shares; and
(v) on the proposed Exchange Date, all PERLS XII will 
Exchange in accordance with clause 7.
(c) The Second Mandatory Exchange Condition and Third 
Mandatory Exchange Condition apply if a Change 
of Control Event occurs as though the proposed 
Exchange Date were a Mandatory Exchange Date for 
the purposes of clause 4 (except that in the case of 
a Change of Control Event, the Second Mandatory 
Exchange Condition will apply as if it referred to 
20.20% of the Issue Date VWAP). 
(d) If either the Second Mandatory Exchange Condition or 
Third Mandatory Exchange Condition is not satisfied 
on the proposed Exchange Date: 
(i) PERLS XII must Exchange on the next Distribution 
Payment Date on which the Second Mandatory 
Exchange Condition and Third Mandatory 
Exchange Condition are satisfied; and
(ii) CBA will notify Holders as soon as practicable after 
the proposed Exchange Date that Exchange did 
not occur.
4.8 
 No Exchange at the option of the 
Holders
Holders do not have a right to request Exchange of their 
PERLS XII at any time.
5 
Early Redemption
5.1 
 Early Redemption at the option of CBA 
on the Call Date
CBA may at its option Redeem all or some PERLS XII on 
the Call Date for their Face Value. 
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if 
CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business Days) 
before the Call Date to ASX and the Holders.
If only some (but not all) PERLS XII are to be Redeemed 
under this clause, those PERLS XII to be Redeemed will 
be specified in the notice and selected:
(a) in a manner that is, in the opinion of CBA, fair and 
reasonable; and
(b) in compliance with any applicable law, directive or 
requirement of ASX.

5.2 
 Early Redemption for inability to frank 
Distributions
If there is a material risk that as a result of any change in, 
or amendment to, the laws of Australia, or their application 
or official or judicial interpretation or administration 
(including any announcement of a prospective change or 
amendment which has been or will be introduced), which 
change or amendment was not expected by CBA as at the 
Issue Date and has or is expected to become effective on 
or after the Issue Date, any Distribution would not be a 
frankable distribution within the meaning of Division 202 
of the Tax Act, CBA may Redeem all (but not some) 
PERLS XII for their Face Value.
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if:
(a) CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the proposed Redemption Date to ASX 
and the Holders;
(b) the proposed Redemption Date is a Distribution 
Payment Date; and
(c) the notice of Redemption is not given earlier than 
60 Business Days before the Distribution Payment Date 
occurring immediately before the earliest date on which 
a Distribution would not be a frankable Distribution.
5.3 
 Early Redemption for other taxation 
reasons
If CBA receives an opinion from reputable legal counsel or 
other tax adviser in Australia, experienced in such matters, 
to the effect that there is a material risk that as a result 
of a change in, or amendment to, the laws of Australia, 
or their application or official or judicial interpretation 
or administration (including any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or 
will be introduced), which change or amendment was 
not expected by CBA at the Issue Date and becomes or is 
expected to become effective on or after the Issue Date: 
(a) CBA would be required to pay an increased amount 
under clause 9.6; or
(b) CBA would be exposed to a more than de minimis 
adverse tax consequence in relation to PERLS XII other 
than a tax consequence that CBA expected as at the 
Issue Date, 
CBA may Redeem all (but not some) PERLS XII for their 
Face Value.
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if:
(c) CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the proposed Redemption Date to ASX 
and the Holders;
(d) the proposed Redemption Date is a Distribution 
Payment Date; and
(e) the notice of Redemption is not given earlier than 
60 Business Days before the Distribution Payment 
Date occurring immediately before the earliest date 
on which CBA would be subject to the adverse tax 
consequence.
5.4 
 Early redemption for regulatory 
reasons
If, at any time after the Issue Date, CBA determines that 
as a result of a change in, or amendment to, the laws of 
Australia or APRAs prudential standards or guidelines, 
or in their application or official or judicial interpretation 
or administration (including any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or will 
be introduced), all, some or a proportion of all or some 
PERLS XII are not or will not be treated as Tier 1 Capital 
of the CBA Group under APRAs prudential standards (as 
amended from time to time), other than as a result of 
a change of treatment expected by CBA as at the Issue 
Date, CBA may Redeem all (but not some) PERLS XII for 
their Face Value.
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if:
(a) CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the proposed Redemption Date to ASX 
and the Holders;
(b) the proposed Redemption Date is a Distribution 
Payment Date; and
(c) the notice of Redemption is not given earlier than 
60 Business Days before the Distribution Payment 
Date occurring immediately before the earliest date 
on which all, some or a proportion of all or some 
PERLS XII will cease to be treated as Tier 1 Capital.
5.5 
APRA approval to Redeem
CBA may only Redeem under this clause 5 if:
(a) either:
(i) before or concurrently with Redemption, CBA 
replaces PERLS XII with a capital instrument which 
is of the same or better quality (for the purposes 
of APRAs prudential standards as they are applied 
to the CBA Group at the relevant time) than 
PERLS XII and the replacement of PERLS XII is 
done under conditions that are sustainable for the 
income capacity of CBA; or
(ii) CBA obtains confirmation from APRA that APRA 
is satisfied, having regard to the capital position of 
the CBA Level 1 Group and CBA Level 2 Group, that 
CBA does not have to replace PERLS XII; and
(b) APRA has given its prior written approval to the 
Redemption. Approval is at the discretion of APRA and 
may or may not be given.
5.6 
Final Distribution
For the avoidance of doubt, Redemption may occur even 
if CBA, in its absolute discretion, does not make the 
Distribution for the final Distribution Period. 
5.7 
 No Redemption at the option of the 
Holders
Holders do not have a right to request Redemption of 
their PERLS XII at any time.
5.8 
Effect of notice of Redemption
Any notice of Redemption given under this clause 5 is 
irrevocable and CBA must (subject to clauses 1.5, 4.5(d) 
and 9.3) Redeem PERLS XII on the Redemption Date 
specified in that notice.
For personal use only

Resale on the Call Date
(a) CBA may elect that Resale occur in relation to all or 
some PERLS XII by giving a Resale Notice at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the Call Date to ASX and the Holders.
If only some (but not all) PERLS XII are to be Resold 
under this clause, the number of PERLS XII to be 
Resold will be specified in the notice and selected:
(i) in a manner that is, in the opinion of CBA, fair and 
reasonable; and
(ii) in compliance with any applicable law, directive or 
requirement of ASX.
(b) If CBA issues a Resale Notice:
(i) each Holder is taken irrevocably to offer to sell the 
relevant number of their PERLS XII to the Purchaser 
on the Call Date (Resale Date) for a cash amount 
per PERLS XII equal to the Face Value (and to 
have appointed CBA as its agent and attorney to 
do and execute all things and documents which 
CBA considers may be necessary or desirable in 
connection with that offer and any resulting sale); 
(ii) subject to payment by the Purchaser of the Face 
Value to Holders, all right, title and interest in the 
relevant number of PERLS XII will be transferred 
from the Holders to the Purchaser on the Resale 
Date; and
(iii) if the Purchaser does not pay the Face Value to the 
relevant Holders on the Resale Date, the relevant 
number of PERLS XII will not be transferred to the 
Purchaser and a Holder has no claim on CBA as a 
result of that non-payment.
(c) Clause 9 will apply to payments by the Purchaser 
as if the Purchaser was CBA. If any payment to a 
particular Holder is not made or treated as made on 
the Resale Date because of any error by or on behalf 
of the Purchaser, the relevant PERLS XII of that Holder 
will not be transferred until payment is made but the 
transfer of all other relevant PERLS will not be affected 
by the failure.
7 
 General provisions 
applicable to Exchange
7.1 
Exchange
On the Exchange Date, subject to clauses 4.6 and 7.10, the 
following will apply:
(a) CBA will allot and issue the Exchange Number of 
Ordinary Shares for each PERLS XII held by the Holder. 
The Exchange Number is calculated according to the 
following formula, and subject always to the Exchange 
Number being no greater than the Maximum 
Exchange Number:
Exchange Number 
for each PERLS XII =
Face Value
0.99  VWAP
where:
VWAP (expressed in dollars and cents) means the 
VWAP during the VWAP Period.
Maximum Exchange Number means a number 
calculated according to the following formula:
Maximum Exchange 
Number 
=
Face Value
Relevant Percentage  
Issue Date VWAP
where:
Relevant Percentage means:
(i) if Exchange is occurring on a Mandatory Exchange 
Date, 0.50; and 
(ii) if Exchange is occurring at any other time, 0.20.
(b) Each Holders rights (including to payment of 
Distributions, other than the Distribution, if any, 
payable on an Exchange Date where the Exchange is 
not as a result of a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-
Viability Trigger Event) in relation to each PERLS XII 
that is being Exchanged will be immediately and 
irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the 
Face Value and CBA will apply the Face Value of each 
PERLS XII by way of payment for the subscription for 
the Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued under 
clause 7.1 (a). Each Holder is taken to have irrevocably 
directed that any amount payable under this clause 7.1 
is to be applied as provided for in this clause and no 
Holder has any right to payment in any other way.
(c) If the total number of additional Ordinary Shares to be 
allotted and issued in respect of a Holders aggregate 
holding of PERLS XII includes a fraction of an Ordinary 
Share, that fraction of an Ordinary Share will be 
disregarded.
7.2 
Adjustments to VWAP generally
For the purposes of calculating VWAP under clause 7.1:
(a) where, on some or all of the Business Days in the 
relevant VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been 
quoted on ASX as cum dividend or cum any other 
distribution or entitlement and PERLS XII will be 
Exchanged for Ordinary Shares after that date and 
those Ordinary Shares will no longer carry that 
dividend or any other distribution or entitlement, 
then the VWAP on the Business Days on which those 
Ordinary Shares have been quoted cum dividend 
or cum any other distribution or entitlement will be 
reduced by an amount (Cum Value) equal to:
(i) in the case of a dividend or other distribution, the 
amount of that dividend or other distribution; 
(ii) in the case of any other entitlement that is not a 
dividend or other distribution under clause 7.2(a)(i) 
which is traded on ASX on any of those Business 
Days, the volume weighted average price of all 
such entitlements sold on ASX during the VWAP 
Period on the Business Days on which those 
entitlements were traded (excluding trades of the 
kind that would be excluded in determining VWAP 
under the definition of that term); or

(iii) in the case of any other entitlement which is not 
traded on ASX during the VWAP Period, the value 
of the entitlement as reasonably determined by 
the Board; and
(b) where, on some or all of the Business Days in the 
VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted as 
ex dividend or ex any other distribution or entitlement, 
and PERLS XII will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares 
which would be entitled to receive the relevant 
dividend, distribution or entitlement, the VWAP on the 
Business Days on which those Ordinary Shares have 
been quoted ex dividend or ex any other distribution 
or entitlement will be increased by the Cum Value.
7.3 
 Adjustments to VWAP for capital 
reconstruction
(a) Where during the relevant VWAP Period there is a 
change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue 
because the Ordinary Shares are reconstructed, 
consolidated, divided or reclassified (not involving any 
payment or other compensation to or by the holders 
of Ordinary Shares) (Reclassification) into a lesser or 
greater number, the daily VWAP for each day in the 
VWAP Period which falls before the date on which 
trading in Ordinary Shares is conducted on a post 
Reclassification basis will be adjusted by multiplying 
the applicable VWAP by the following formula:
A
B
Where:
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares 
immediately before the Reclassification; and
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares 
immediately after the Reclassification. 
(b) Any adjustment made by CBA in accordance with 
clause 7.3(a) will be effective and binding on Holders 
under these Terms and these Terms will be construed 
accordingly. 
(c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 
allows a cash payment or other distribution to be 
made to or by a Holder as part of a Reclassification or 
as a result of a Reclassification.
7.4 
 Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
generally
For the purposes of determining the Issue Date VWAP 
under clause 7.1, adjustments will be made in accordance 
with clauses 7.2 and 7.3 during the VWAP Period for 
the Issue Date VWAP. On and from the Issue Date, 
adjustments to the Issue Date VWAP:
(a) may be made by CBA in accordance with clauses 7.5 to 
7.7 (inclusive);
(b) if so made, will correspondingly affect the application 
of the Mandatory Exchange Conditions and cause an 
adjustment to the Maximum Exchange Number; and
(c) if so made, will be effective and binding on Holders 
under these Terms and these Terms will be construed 
accordingly.
7.5 
 Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
bonus issues
(a) Subject to clauses 7.5(b) and 7.5(c), if CBA makes a 
pro-rata bonus issue of Ordinary Shares to holders 
of Ordinary Shares generally, the Issue Date VWAP 
will be adjusted immediately in accordance with the 
following formula:
V = Vo x RD/(RD + RN)
Where:
V 
 means the Issue Date VWAP applying 
immediately after the application of this formula;
Vo 
 means the Issue Date VWAP applying 
immediately prior to the application of this 
formula;
RD  means the number of Ordinary Shares on issue 
immediately prior to the allotment of new 
Ordinary Shares pursuant to the bonus issue; and
RN  means the number of Ordinary Shares issued 
pursuant to the bonus issue.
(b) Clause 7.5(a) does not apply to Ordinary Shares issued 
as part of a bonus share plan, employee or executive 
share plan, executive option plan, share top up plan, 
share purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment plan.
(c) For the purposes of this clause 7.5, an issue will be 
regarded as a bonus issue notwithstanding that 
CBA does not make offers to some or all holders of 
Ordinary Shares with registered addresses outside 
Australia (or to whom an offer is otherwise subject to 
foreign securities laws), provided that in so doing CBA 
is not in contravention of ASX Listing Rules.
7.6 
 Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
capital reconstruction
If at any time after the Issue Date there is a change to 
the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because of a 
Reclassification into a lesser or greater number, the Issue 
Date VWAP will be adjusted by multiplying the Issue Date 
VWAP applicable on the Business Day immediately before 
the date of any such Reclassification by the following 
formula:
A
B
where:
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on 
issue immediately before the Reclassification; and
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on 
issue immediately after the Reclassification. 
7.7 
 No adjustment to Issue Date VWAP in 
certain circumstances
Despite the provisions of clauses 7.5 and 7.6, no 
adjustment will be made to the Issue Date VWAP where 
any such adjustment (rounded if applicable) would be less 
than one percent of the Issue Date VWAP then in effect.
For personal use only

7.8 
 Announcement of adjustments to Issue 
Date VWAP
CBA will notify any adjustment to the Issue Date VWAP 
under this clause 7 to ASX and the Holders within 
10 Business Days of CBA determining the adjustment (or 
such shorter period as is required by ASX Listing Rules) 
and the adjustment will be final and binding.
7.9 
Status and listing of Ordinary Shares
(a) Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange will 
rank equally with all other fully paid Ordinary Shares 
provided that the rights attaching to the Ordinary 
Shares issued or arising from Exchange do not take 
effect until 5.00pm (Sydney time) on the Exchange 
Date (or such other time required by APRA).
(b) CBA will use all reasonable endeavours to list the 
Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange of PERLS XII on 
ASX.
(c) Holders acknowledge that any ASX trades in PERLSXII 
that have not settled on the Exchange Date will 
continue to settle in accordance with the normal ASX 
settlement process, although the seller will be treated 
as having delivered and the buyer will be treated as 
having acquired, the number of Ordinary Shares into 
which PERLS XII have been Exchanged. 
7.10 
 Exchange where the Holder does not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an 
Ineligible Holder
If PERLS XII (or percentage of the Face Value of each 
PERLS XII) of a Holder are required to be Exchanged and:
(a) the Holder has notified CBA that it does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares as a result of Exchange, which 
notice may be given at any time on or after the Issue 
Date and prior to the Exchange Date;
(b) the Holder is an Ineligible Holder; or
(c) CBA has not received (for any reason whether or 
not due to the fault of that Holder) any information 
required by it in accordance with the Terms so as to 
impede CBA issuing the Ordinary Shares to a Holder 
on the Exchange Date,
then, on the Exchange Date, the Holders rights 
(including to payment of Distributions) in relation to 
each such PERLS XII being Exchanged are immediately 
and irrevocably terminated and CBA will issue the 
Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a Nominee for 
no additional consideration to hold on trust for sale for 
the benefit of the relevant Holder (unless, because the 
Holder is an Ineligible Holder, the Nominee is deemed 
to be an Ineligible Holder, in which case such issue shall 
occur as soon as practicable after the Nominee ceases 
to be an Ineligible Holder). At the first opportunity to sell 
the Ordinary Shares, the Nominee will arrange for their 
sale and pay the proceeds less selling costs to the relevant 
Holder subject to and in accordance with the provisions of 
the Deed Poll.
If Exchange is occurring because of the occurrence of 
a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
and the Exchange fails to take effect and CBA has not 
otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the Nominee within 
five Business Days after the date of the occurrence of 
the Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then Holders rights will be immediately and irrevocably 
terminated under clause 4.6.
7.11 
Final Distribution 
For the avoidance of doubt, Exchange may occur even 
if CBA, in its absolute discretion, does not make the 
Distribution for the final Distribution Period.
7.12 
 No Exchange after winding up 
commences
If before the Exchange Date an order is made by a court, 
or an effective resolution is passed, for the winding up 
of CBA in Australia, then Exchange will not occur and 
clause 1.5 will apply, except where Exchange is required 
for a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
(in which case such Exchange shall occur (subject to 
clause 4.6) in accordance with clauses 4.1 or 4.2 (as 
applicable) and clause 4.5).
7.13 
 Exchange of a percentage of Face Value
If under these Terms it is necessary to Exchange a 
percentage of the Face Value, this clause 7 will apply to 
the Exchange as if references to the Face Value were 
references to the relevant percentage of the Face Value to 
be Exchanged.

 Title and transfer of 
PERLSXII
8.1 
Effect of entries in Register
Each entry in the Register of a person as a Holder 
constitutes: 
(a) conclusive evidence of that persons:
(i) absolute ownership of that PERLS XII; 
(ii) entitlement to the other benefits given to Holders 
under these Terms and the Deed Poll in respect of 
PERLS XII; and
(b) an undertaking by CBA to pay Distributions and any 
other amount in accordance with these Terms,
subject to correction of the Register for fraud or error.
8.2 
Non-recognition of interests
Except as required by law, CBA and the Registry must 
treat the person whose name is entered in the Register 
as a Holder as the absolute owner of that PERLS XII. This 
clause applies despite any notice of ownership, trust or 
interest in that PERLS XII. No recognition of any trust, 
encumbrance or interest shall be entered on the Register.
8.3 
Joint holders
Where two or more persons are entered in the Register 
as joint Holders, they are taken to hold that PERLS XII as 
joint tenants with rights of survivorship and subject to the 
terms of the Deed Poll but the Registry is not bound to 
register more than three persons as joint Holders of any 
PERLS XII.

(A)  by a proper transfer under any other applicable 
computerised or electronic system recognised 
by the Corporations Act; or

are entered in the Register.
(c) PERLS XII may be transferred in whole but not in part.
(d) CBA must comply with all Applicable Regulations

determine that transfers of some or all PERLS XII 
will not be registered during any period reasonably 
specified by it prior to the Exchange Date, 
Redemption Date or Resale Date of such PERLS XII.
8.5 
Refusal to register
CBA may only refuse to register a transfer of PERLS XII if 
permitted by, or if such registration would contravene or is 
forbidden by, Applicable Regulations or the Terms.
If CBA refuses to register a transfer, CBA must give the 
lodging party notice of the refusal and the reasons for 
it within five Business Days after the date on which the 
transfer was delivered to the Registry.
8.6 
Transmission
A person becoming entitled to PERLS XII as a 
consequence of the death, bankruptcy, liquidation or a 
winding-up of a Holder or of a vesting order by a court 
or other body with power to make the order, or a person 
administering the estate of a Holder, may, upon providing 
evidence as to that entitlement or status, and if CBA 
so requires an indemnity in relation to the correctness 
of such evidence, as CBA considers sufficient, become 
registered as the Holder of those PERLS XII.
9 
Payments
9.1 
Payments to registered Holder
(a) Payment of Distributions will be made to the person 
registered at 7.00pm on the Record Date as the 
Holder.
(b) Payment of any other amount in accordance with 
these Terms will be made to the person registered as 
the Holder on the relevant date for payment.
(c) A payment to any one of joint Holders will discharge 
CBAs liability in respect of the payment.
9.2 
Payments subject to law
All payments are subject to applicable law.
9.3 
Payments on Business Days
If any payment:
(a) is due on a day which is not a Business Day, then the 
due date for payment will be the next Business Day; or
(b) is to be made to an account on a Business Day 
on which banks are not open for general banking 
business in the place in which the account is located, 
then the due date for payment will be the next day on 
which banks are open for general banking business in 
that place. 
No additional amount is payable in respect of any delay 
in payment. Nothing in this clause 9.3 applies to any 
payment referred to in clause 7.1(b).
9.4 
Payments to accounts
Monies payable by CBA to a Holder may be paid by 
crediting an Australian dollar bank account maintained 
in Australia with a financial institution and nominated in 
writing by the Holder by close of business on the relevant 
Record Date or in any other manner CBA decides. 
9.5 
Unsuccessful attempts to pay
(a) If the Holder has not notified the Registry of a bank 
account for the purposes of payment under clause9.4 
or the transfer of any amount does not complete 
for any reason (other than an error made by or on 
behalf of CBA), CBA will be treated as having paid the 
amount on the date on which it would otherwise have 
made the payment.
(b) CBA will send a notice to the registered address of 
the Holder advising of the unsuccessful payment 
and the amount of the unsuccessful payment will 
be held on deposit in a non-interest bearing bank 
account maintained by CBA or the Registry until the 
Holder nominates an Australian dollar bank account 
maintained in Australia for crediting with the payment 
(or nominates a new bank account as the case may 
be) or the claim becomes void under clause 12.1. 
(c) No additional amount is payable in respect of any 
delay in payment.
(d) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 9.5 
obliges CBA to make a payment it has not otherwise 
determined to make under clause 2.

9.6 
Withholdings and Deductions
(a) All payments in respect of PERLS XII must be made 
without any withholding or deduction in respect of 
taxes, unless the withholding or deduction is required 
by law or permitted by this clause 9.6. CBA shall pay 
the full amount deducted to the relevant revenue 
authority within the time allowed for such payment 
without incurring penalty under the applicable law and 
shall, if required by any Holder, deliver to that Holder 
the relevant receipt issued by the revenue authority 
without delay after it is received by CBA.
(b) CBA, in its absolute discretion, may withhold or deduct 
payments to a Holder (including, if applicable, any 
other person who beneficially derives Distributions 
under PERLS XII) where it is required to do so under or 
in connection with FATCA, or where it has reasonable 
grounds to suspect that the Holder or a beneficial 
owner of PERLS XII may be subject to FATCA, and may 
deal with such payment and the Holders PERLS XII 
in accordance with FATCA. If any withholding or 
deduction arises under or in connection with FATCA, 
CBA will not be required to pay any further amounts on 
account of such withholding or deduction or otherwise 
reimburse or compensate, or make any payment to, 
a Holder or a beneficial owner of PERLS XII for or in 
respect of any such withholding or deduction.
(c) Each Holder (including, if applicable, any other 
person who beneficially derives Distributions under 
PERLS XII) will, within 10 Business Days of request by 
CBA, supply to CBA such forms, documentation and 
other information relating to its status under FATCA as 
CBA reasonably requests for the purposes of the CBA 
Group's compliance with FATCA.
10 
 Tax File Number 
withholdings
(a) CBA will withhold an amount from payments of 
Distributions on PERLS XII at the highest marginal tax 
rate plus the highest Medicare levy if a Holder has not 
supplied an appropriate tax file number, Australian 
business number or exemption details.
(b) If a Holder supplies exemption details and CBA 
subsequently determines that the relevant exemption 
was not available, CBA may recover the amount that 
should have been deducted from the relevant Holder 
and may deduct that amount from any subsequent 
payment due to that Holder in respect of PERLS XII. 
11 
Substitution of CBA
11.1 
Substitution
CBA may, in connection with a NOHC Event, without the 
consent of Holders and provided that the Substitution 
Conditions are satisfied, by giving notice to ASX and the 
Holders:
(a) substitute for itself a NOHC as the debtor in respect 
of PERLS XII and as the issuer of Ordinary Shares on 
Exchange (Full Successor); or
(b) substitute for itself a NOHC as the issuer of Ordinary 
Shares on Exchange (Partial Successor),
and a reference to the Successor shall be a reference to 
the Full Successor or the Partial Successor, as applicable. 
The notice shall specify the date on which the substitution 
is to take effect (Date of Substitution).
11.2 
Substitution Conditions
The Substitution Conditions are:
(a) in the case of the Full Successor:
(i) the Full Successor or another entity (which is a 
parent entity) subscribes for Ordinary Shares or 
other capital instruments acceptable to APRA in 
such amount as may be necessary, or takes other 
steps acceptable to APRA, to ensure that the 
capital position of the CBA Level 1 Group and CBA 
Level 2 Group will not be adversely affected;
(ii) the Full Successor will expressly assume CBAs 
obligations under these Terms and the Deed Poll 
by entering into a deed poll for the benefit of 
Holders (Successor Deed Poll) under which it 
agrees (among other things):
(A) to comply with the restrictions in clause 2.7 of 
these Terms (with all necessary modifications); 
and
(B) to deliver fully paid ordinary shares in its 
capital under all circumstances when CBA 
would otherwise have been required to deliver 
Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms 
and conditions as set out in these Terms (with 
all necessary modifications); 
(b) in the case of the Partial Successor:
(i) the Partial Successor agrees with effect on and 
from the Date of Substitution, by entering into a 
Successor Deed Poll, to deliver fully paid ordinary 
shares in its capital under all circumstances when 
CBA would otherwise have been required to 
deliver Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms 
and conditions as set out in these Terms (with all 
necessary modifications); and
(ii) the Partial Successor agrees that in all circumstances 
where the Partial Successor delivers fully paid 
ordinary shares in its capital under the Successor 
Deed Poll in clause 11.2(b)(i), the Partial Successor 
or another entity (which is a parent entity) will 
subscribe for Ordinary Shares in such amount as 
may be necessary, or take other steps acceptable to 
APRA, to ensure that the capital position of the CBA 
Level 1 Group and CBA Level 2 Group is equivalent 
to the position if the Successor Deed Poll had not 
been entered into and CBA was required to issue 
the Ordinary Shares; and

The Distribution Rate is the Market Rate plus the Margin, multiplied by (1  Tax Rate)5.

Mandatory Exchange Date (subject to the Maximum Exchange Number and Mandatory 
Exchange Conditions) and may, at CBAs option, Redeem PERLS XII on the Call Date 
(subject to APRA approval),7 or may Exchange or Redeem PERLS XII earlier on the 
occurrence of certain events.  
 
Holders do not have a right to request that their PERLS XII be Redeemed or Exchanged 
early for any reason. To realise their investment, Holders can sell their PERLS XII on ASX at 
the prevailing market price8. 
Mandatory 
Exchange Date 
 
20 April 2029, or if the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are not satisfied on that date, the 
first Distribution Payment Date after that date on which the Mandatory Exchange Conditions 
are satisfied. 
 
On the Mandatory Exchange Date, Holders will receive for each PERLS XII a variable 
number of Ordinary Shares with a value approximately equal to A$101.019. This is subject to 
the Maximum Exchange Number and Mandatory Exchange Conditions. 
Early Exchange 
 
CBA must Exchange all, some or a proportion of PERLS XII if a Capital Trigger Event or 
Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs. 
 
CBA must Exchange all (but not some) of PERLS XII if a Change of Control Event occurs.

3 Eligible Securityholders must have a registered address in Australia.

adjustment to the amount of the Distribution payable. 
5 The Australian corporate tax rate on the relevant Distribution Payment Date, currently 30%. 
6 Distributions may be unfranked or not fully franked. If a Distribution is unfranked or not fully franked, the cash Distribution will be 
grossed-up according to a formula under the Terms. Holders should be aware that the ability of a Holder to use franking credits will 
depend on their individual position and that the potential value of franking credits does not accrue at the same time as the cash 
Distribution is received. 
7 Approval is at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given. 
8 PERLS XII may be trading at a market price below the Face Value and/or the market for PERLS XII may not be liquid. For further 
information about liquidity risks associated with PERLS XII, see Section 4.2.12 of the Prospectus. 
9 The number of Ordinary Shares is based on the Face Value (initially A$100) and the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during the 20 
Business Days before the Mandatory Exchange Date with the benefit of a 1% discount. This may differ from the price of Ordinary 
Shares on or after Exchange, and therefore the value of Ordinary Shares received on Exchange of each PERLS XII may be more or 
less than A$101.01 (based on Initial Face Value of A$100). 
10 Approval is at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given.

capital (interests) 
PERLS XII are scheduled to pay non-cumulative, 
floating 
rate 
(Australian 
money 
market 
benchmark interest rate (Market Rate) plus a 
Margin to be determined through a bookbuild, 
with the resulting rate multiplied by (1  Tax Rate)) 
distributions (Distributions) quarterly until all 
PERLS XII are Exchanged or Redeemed, subject to 
(a) CBA, in its absolute discretion, making the 
Distribution to PERLS XII holders; (b) the 
payment of the Distribution not resulting in a 
breach of CBAs capital requirements under 
APRAs prudential standards as they are applied to 
the CBA Level 1 Group or the CBA Level 2 Group 
or both at the time of payment; (c) the payment of 
the Distribution not resulting in CBA becoming, 
or being likely to become, Insolvent; and (d) APRA 
not otherwise objecting to the payment of the 
Distribution. Distributions that are not paid do 
not accrue and will not be subsequently paid. 
No Distribution will be paid on Exchange where 
Exchange occurs due to a Capital Trigger Event or 
a Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
CBAs dividend policy in respect of its Ordinary 
Shares is unchanged. However, if distributions of 
PERLS XII are not paid on the relevant 
Distribution 
Payment 
Date 
and 
until 
a 
Distribution is paid in full on a subsequent 
Distribution Payment Date (or all PERLS XII are 
Exchanged, Redeemed or otherwise terminated), 
CBA will be restricted from paying dividends on 
(or returning capital on or undertaking buy-backs 
of) Ordinary Shares, subject to certain limited 
expectations.

1 
+Quotation of our additional +securities is in ASXs absolute discretion.  ASX
may quote the +securities on any conditions it decides.  
2 
We warrant the following to ASX. 

The issue of the +securities to be quoted complies with the law and is
not for an illegal purpose.

There is no reason why those +securities should not be granted
+quotation.

An offer of the +securities for sale within 12 months after their issue will
not require disclosure under section 707(3) or section 1012C(6) of the
Corporations Act.
Note: An entity may need to obtain appropriate warranties from subscribers for the securities in order to be able 
to give this warranty 

Section 724 or section 1016E of the Corporations Act does not apply to
any applications received by us in relation to any +securities to be
quoted and that no-one has any right to return any +securities to be
quoted under sections 737, 738 or 1016F of the Corporations Act at the
time that we request that the +securities be quoted.

If we are a trust, we warrant that no person has the right to return the
+securities to be quoted under section 1019B of the Corporations Act at
the time that we request that the +securities be quoted.
3 
We will indemnify ASX to the fullest extent permitted by law in respect of any 
claim, action or expense arising from or connected with any breach of the 
warranties in this agreement. 
4 
We give ASX the information and documents required by this form.  If any 
information or document is not available now, we will give it to ASX before 
+quotation of the +securities begins.  We acknowledge that ASX is relying on
the information and documents.  We warrant that they are (will be) true and
complete.

ASX announcement 
APRA consultation on the Measurement 
of Capital (APS 111) 
Tuesday, 15 October 2019 (Sydney): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today notes the release of the 
consultation paper by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) on the APRA Prudential Standard 111  
Capital Adequacy: Measurement of Capital (APS 111). 
The consultation paper outlines, among others, APRAs proposal to change its existing approach on equity exposures 
to banking and insurance subsidiaries of Australian Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs). APRA has proposed 
that each individual equity exposure will be risk-weighted at 250% up to 10% of the ADIs Level 1 Common Equity Tier 
1 (CET1) capital, with any excess above that threshold to be deducted from CET1 capital. 
As at 30 June 2019, CBAs Level 1 CET1 ratio was 11.2%, which was 50bps higher than the Level 2 CET1 ratio of 
10.7%. 
If implemented, the proposals will not impact CBAs Level 2 CET1 ratio. On a pro-forma basis, based on CBAs 
current equity investments, and assuming the RBNZ capital proposals require CBA to inject approximately NZ$3bn of 
additional capital into ASB Bank Limited, the proposals would reduce CBAs Level 1 CET1 ratio by approximately 
30bps. 
Sufficient capacity exists under APRAs related party limits under APS 222 to accommodate CBAs exposures to its 
related entities, including the potential RBNZ capital requirement. 
The final impact will depend on the outcome of the APRA consultation and the final RBNZ capital rules.  
APRA is seeking submissions on the proposals by 31 January 2020 and CBA will participate in the consultation 
process. 
APRAs announcement is available at www.apra.gov.au.

CEOs address 
2019 Annual General Meeting 
Sydney, Wednesday 16 October 
Check against delivery 
Opening remarks 
Thank you Catherine. And good morning everyone.  
Id also like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which were meeting and pay my respects to Elders 
past and present. 
It continues to be an enormous privilege to lead the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on your behalf  a business 
which has played such an important role in our country for more than 100 years. 
When we were established in December 1911 we had a very clear mandate. 
There were three parts to that mandate  and they are just as relevant today as they were then.  
The Commonwealth Bank was to be a bank for all Australians.  
It was to be a bank for businesses to help them grow, and for the economy to flourish.  
And it was to be a bank for the country, to help all people prosper, and of which the nation could be proud. 
And when you trace our history back, that is the role that we have played in peoples lives through wars, recessions, 
challenging as well as prosperous economic times, when people were starting a business, buying a home, or planning 
their future.  
While our role and mandate have not changed; our context has changed, and we must too.  
We are changing to become a simpler, better bank to ensure we uphold our legacy and achieve our purpose - to 
improve the financial wellbeing of our customers and the communities we serve. 
Building a simpler, better Commonwealth Bank 
Last year, I spoke to you about the issues we needed to address and the actions we were taking. 
As the Chair has outlined, weve continued to take significant action this year to simplify our portfolio, simplify the way 
we operate, and put things right for our customers.

Over the past year, Ive had the opportunity to interact with thousands of our customers, shareholders and members 
of the community. 
This includes the nearly 14,000 people who took the time to write to me with their thoughts, ideas and concerns in 
response to a letter I sent to our 8 million customers last year. 
Weve listened to their feedback, and since then weve introduced big and small changes every week. 
Some of these changes have included removing a number of banking fees for our business customers, providing 
smart alerts and notifications to help customers avoid fees and better manage their finances, and introducing 
measures to support farmers and regional communities.  
This is just the beginning. 
Ive written to our customers again recently to update them on our progress and to hear what else is on their minds.  
Im also holding a customer forum next month to hear from them directly. This is the first of a number of forums I will 
be holding in regional areas and cities around the country next year. 
I also look forward to hearing your feedback later this morning. My leadership team and I will be available to speak 
with you after the meeting. 
I recognise there is still much more to do to become a simpler, better bank, but I hope you are starting to see and 
experience some of the changes weve made. 
Delivering for our customers 
Looking ahead, were committed to combining the best service and technology to deliver exceptional experiences for 
our customers, however they choose to interact with us. 
Whether its using a passbook in the largest branch network in Australia, speaking with one of our team in our six 
Australia-based contact centres, or banking anywhere, anytime online. 
With customers increasingly choosing to interact with us online, being the best in digital continues to be a key part of 
our strategy.  
With 7m active digital customers and 7.4m logons per day, were doing all we can to make banking more personalised 
and more convenient. 
Our mobile banking app was recently rated #1 in the Asia-Pacific for the third year in a row by Forrester, and we have 
been rated the best online bank for 10 years in a row by Canstar. 
We recently relaunched the CommBank app to make it smarter, and more tailored to our customers individual needs.  
We are now notifying customers through our mobile app when bills are due, when suspicious activity has occurred on 
their account, or how their spending compares with prior months.  
Our Benefits finder feature aims to connect customers with $150 million in rebates and benefits each year, and by 
improving customer notifications, alerts and reminders we are helping customers avoid fees and save money. 
Weve also strengthened security protections, including 24/7 real-time monitoring and new in-branch and eLearning

Delivering for our community  
As well as making sure were delivering exceptional customer service and leading technology, were also focused on 
making meaningful contributions to our communities. 
Weve been a long-standing advocate of financial education. 
From the simple act of providing children with a small metal money box 88 years ago, today school banking is 
supported by more than 10,000 volunteers helping children learn about saving.  
Through StartSmart, we are also now the largest financial education provider in the world, reaching more than 
430,000 Australian students each year.  
We are also taking steps to be there for our customers and communities when they need us most. 
Weve increased our support for farmers, creating new programs designed to help them stay on their family properties 
and give them direct financial assistance in times of need. This includes our Drought Assistance Package, interest 
rate credit adjustments and not charging default interest on business term loans. 
Through contributions from the Bank, and the generous support of our customers, we have been able to donate nearly 
$8m to help drought affected farmers. 
Over the past five years weve also been providing assistance to our customers experiencing domestic and family 
violence, and financial abuse.  
We partner with community organisations to help those affected achieve long-term financial independence.  
Over five years weve committed $25 million to help those who experience domestic and financial abuse. We recently 
increased our support with a further $5 million commitment, and have just announced that we are providing unlimited 
paid leave to our own employees affected by domestic and family violence. 
These are just some of our efforts to contribute to the communities in which we operate. 
Business Environment 
Turning now to the economy and our financial performance.  
Uncertainty about the outlook for global growth has increased over the course of this year. 
There are signs that the governments recent tax cuts for many Australian families have supported the economy at 
this time.  
Lower interest rates are a feature globally, and the local cash rate has fallen 75 basis points since May. This low rate 
environment creates challenges for our customers and for financial institutions.  
We very much recognise that customers who rely on interest payments from savings balances have seen this income 
decrease. 
On housing, falling rates have contributed to a turnaround in some established housing markets.  
House prices are now rising in Sydney and Melbourne after having fallen for 18 months, and there are encouraging 
signs that the market has stabilised. 
While regulatory guidance has increased in recent years for home lending, these changes have improved lending 
standards across the industry and have further improved the resilience of the financial system.

Home lending to our customers has grown 30% faster than market growth. This means that we have lent $92bn to our 
home loan customers in the last year.  
There remains an abundance of housing credit available.  
Australian businesses remain the engine room of the economy, and their continued innovation, investment and growth 
is critical. 
Despite challenging conditions in some sectors, such as retail, construction and agriculture, the profitability of 
Australian businesses remains around its historical average. 
This has enabled most businesses to comfortably meet their debt repayments, and creates the capacity for 
investment and innovation.  
We currently lend more than $500m to Australian businesses every week, and have an appetite to do much more. 
It is important that we are able to support Australian businesses to help them to invest, innovate and grow.  
We are very clear on what we need to do to deliver continued performance in the current economic, regulatory and 
competitive environment.  
As the Chair mentioned, our results show the underlying strength of our core business, with home and business 
lending both up 4 per cent, and transaction deposit balances growing by 9 per cent. 
We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet, have unquestionably strong capital levels, and were able to 
maintain our $4.31 dividend. 
A simpler, better bank 
As you can see, we are changing to become a simpler, better bank. 
Of course, this wouldnt be possible without the 48,000 people who work at the Commonwealth Bank. I want to thank 
them all for their continued hard work and dedication. 
And I want to thank you, our shareholders. The majority of you are long-term investors in our business and, of course, 
want to see the Commonwealth Bank do well now, and into the future.  
We know what we need to do to be a better bank, that is worthy of the Australian people we serve  one better 
equipped to deliver on the promise on which we were first established: 
To be a bank for all Australians  
To be a bank for businesses to help them grow and the economy to flourish 
To be a bank for the country, to help all people prosper and of which the nation can be proud. 
Let me pass you back to the Chair.

ASX announcement  
Chairmans address 
2019 Annual General Meeting 
Sydney, Wednesday 16 October 
Check against delivery 
 
Opening remarks 
Shareholders, 2019 has been an important year for the Bank. 
Our strategy to become a simpler, better bank, in order to deliver better outcomes for our customers and 
shareholders, is well underway, and good progress has been achieved in divesting non-core businesses.  
Despite a subdued economy, the Bank delivered strong operating results, and CBAs capital position is 
unquestionably strong.  
Importantly, however, we have pursued a wide ranging program to improve governance, accountability and risk 
management, which are fundamental to changing the culture at CBA.  
The Banks clearer lines of management accountability, and stronger risk management practices, are improving our 
ability to meet higher regulatory and compliance obligations, and deliver on the expectations of customers and the 
community more broadly.  
The Boards focus has been on taking meaningful action, following the unreserved acknowledgement of past issues, 
and ensuring, that the character and integrity of our intent, are as important as the competence and capabilities 
required to achieve results.  
All of these qualities are pre-requisites for restoring trust and confidence in the Bank.  
Becoming a simpler, better bank 
We have taken action to become a simpler bank through substantially exiting from our wealth management 
businesses.  
We have sold our New Zealand life insurance business, Sovereign; our asset management business, Colonial First 
State Global Asset Management; and our South African business, TymeDigital. We are now progressing the sales of 
our life insurance operations in Australia, China and Indonesia, and have announced the exit of our Aligned Financial 
Advice businesses in Australia.

We also remain committed to the orderly exit of Colonial First State, and our mortgage broking businesses.  
By simplifying our portfolio we are reducing risk and cost, and can concentrate on the needs of our core banking 
customers, in our core markets.  
In terms of becoming a better bank, we have taken the provisions and actions necessary to ensure that customers 
affected by past issues, particularly in our former wealth management division, are efficiently and appropriately 
compensated.  
We have made deliberate decisions to remove and reduce fees, and have introduced alerts to help customers avoid 
fees. These changes saved our customers $275 million last year, and are expected to save them over $400 million in 
the current year.  
We have changed products, processes and policies, and the way we respond to customer complaints.  
Leadership of the Bank 
Turning now to the Leadership of the Bank. 
The renewal of the Banks Executive Leadership Team has continued, following Matt Comyns appointment as Chief 
Executive Officer in April last year.  
Matt has made 10 new appointments to his leadership team, including both internal promotions and the appointment 
of external candidates, all of high calibre, and bringing skills and expertise in financial services, risk and technology.  
Together, they have the capability and values required to build a more customer-focused culture, and to deliver the 
Banks strategy for the benefit of shareholders.  
Governance, culture, accountability and remuneration 
Three years ago, starting with our Remuneration Framework, the Board began a program to strengthen governance, 
culture and accountability. 
The Board now has greater oversight and scrutiny of the risks facing the Bank, and has set clearer expectations of 
management. There is a focus on better identifying and managing non-financial risks, particularly regulatory 
compliance, conduct and cyber security. 
In this context, the Executive Leadership Team has established a Non-Financial Risk Committee, which provides 
visibility of risk across the Bank, and enables a much improved flow of information to the Board.   
We also have a new Code of Conduct. Drawing on our Purpose and Values, this Code sets out what we expect of our 
people, how they should act, solve problems and make decisions. The guiding principle of the Code is the Should 
We? test, to consciously question and ensure that we are doing the right thing by our customers and the community.   
To reinforce cultural change we continued to improve our remuneration framework, achieving accountability for the 
right outcomes.  This year, we increased the rigour and challenge applied to the risk assessment process, which is a 
major consideration as the Board determines remuneration outcomes for senior executives and the Group as a whole.  
There were remuneration consequences for all Group Executives as a result of the unsatisfactory outcomes for 
customers and shareholders, which of course included the impact of customer remediation provisions on this years 
financial result.  
This is in addition to the reduction of more than $100 million in remuneration for Directors, Executives, senior leaders 
and employees across the 2017 and 2018 financial years. These reductions recognised individual and collective 
accountability for the issues that affected the reputation of the Bank and the findings of APRAs Prudential Inquiry.

Regulatory update 
Following that Inquiry, in April last year, we entered into an Enforceable Undertaking with APRA, to develop a 
Remedial Action Plan in response to the recommendations of the Inquirys Final Report.  We have now delivered 75 of 
the Plans 156 milestones to the independent reviewer, Promontory, who provides a quarterly assessment of our 
progress to APRA.  
Following on from the Final Report of the Financial Services Royal Commission in February this year, we welcomed 
the recent release of the Governments Implementation Roadmap. We have already taken action on a number of the 
recommendations of the Royal Commission to improve outcomes for customers. Some of the recommendations will 
require action by government, regulators and industry bodies before we can implement them. We are supporting this 
work, and taking steps to ensure that we are ready to act once the regulatory framework is in place. 
We have also continued to invest heavily in our financial crimes compliance processes, and are working constructively 
with AUSTRAC to play our part in preventing and disrupting financial crime.  
Sustainable business practice 
Moving now to sustainability.  
We are committed to operating sustainably and responsibly, in the long-term interests of the economy and the broader 
community. Through our Environmental and Social Policy, this commitment is embedded in the way we do business.  
The policy includes a clear commitment to support the responsible global transition to a net zero emissions economy 
 including reducing our exposures to thermal coal and coal fired power generation, with a view to exiting the sector 
by 2030, subject to Australia having a secure energy platform.  
Further, we will only provide banking and financing to new oil, gas or metallurgical coal projects if they can be 
supported, as having environmental, social and economic impacts consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  
Our Green Mortgage Initiative is an example of what we are doing in practice to help Australians benefit from more 
affordable and sustainable energy. Since we launched in August, more than 4,500 existing home loan customers have 
taken advantage of the $500 cashback provided for those who instal solar energy.  
Our Environmental and Social Policy also incorporates our human rights commitments, including our approach to 
managing the risks of modern slavery in our business operations and supply chains.  
Board renewal 
Our commitment to Board renewal has continued in 2019.  
In January we were joined by two new Non-Executive Directors  Professor Genevieve Bell and Mr Paul OMalley. 
Both will be standing for election today.  
Genevieves knowledge and understanding of technology, in society and business, has brought a unique and valuable 
perspective to the Board. Pauls broad operational and finance skills, as well as his experience in business leadership, 
have also added significant value to the Board.  
Current Non-Executive Directors, Mr Shirish Apte and Ms Mary Padbury, will stand for re-election today.  
Sir David Higgins will retire in December in order to focus on his interests in the UK. On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank Sir David for his five years of commitment and service to the Bank, including chairing the Remuneration 
Committee and guiding significant improvements to our Remuneration Framework.

Business performance  
Our financial results this year reflect the actions we have been taking to build a simpler, better bank, including 
customer remediation costs and revenue forgone for the benefit of customers, as well as investment in better 
customer and risk outcomes.  
Our results also reflect the continued strength of the Banks market position, and the performance of our underlying 
business. More Australians than ever now call the CBA their main financial institution  and we have continued to 
deliver strong performance in our core business areas of home loans and transaction accounts.  
The strength of the Banks balance sheet is a key feature. As at 30 June 2019, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio 
was 10.7%, which is above APRAs unquestionably strong benchmark of 10.5%. The subsequent sale of Colonial 
First State Global Asset Management in August, added a further 68 basis points to this ratio.  
The strength of the banks operating and capital performance enabled the Board to declare a final dividend of $2.31 
per share, taking the full year dividend to $4.31 per share, fully franked.  
The progress being made on divestments, together with prudent management of the business, and our balance sheet, 
in the current macroeconomic environment, will continue to support the delivery of sustainable returns for 
shareholders over the long-term.  
Closing remarks 
Shareholders, as I have outlined today, the past year has seen a great deal of critical work undertaken to transform 
your Bank into one which is simpler and better.  
We are absolutely committed to this purpose. It is evident, everywhere I go in CBA, how determined our people are to 
achieve the goals I have described, and I would like to acknowledge how hard our people are working to deliver these 
outcomes.  
To my fellow Directors, thank you for your commitment to securing the Banks future, and to delivering balanced and 
sustainable outcomes for all of our stakeholders.  
And finally, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support as we work to deliver a bank of 
which you can be proud.  
I will now ask our CEO, Matt Comyn, to address the meeting.

under rule 3.9. 
(c) 
The Board may: 
(1) 
exempt a share from all or part of this rule 3.5; and 
(2) 
waive or compromise all or part of any payment due to the company 
under this rule 3.5. 
3.6 
Lien on shares 
(a) 
The company has a first lien on: 
(1) 
each partly paid share for all unpaid calls and instalments due on that 
share; and 
(2) 
each share for any amounts the company is required by law to pay 
and has paid in respect of that share. 
For personal use only
 
 
 
      
 
 
 
Constitution for Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
Contents 16 
 
In each case the lien extends to reasonable interest and expenses incurred 
because the amount is not paid. 
(b) 
The companys lien on a share extends to all dividends payable on the share 
and to the proceeds of sale of the share. 
(c) 
The Board may sell a share on which the company has a lien as it thinks fit 
where: 
(1) 
an amount for which a lien exists under this rule 3.6 is presently 
payable; and 
(2) 
the company has given the registered holder a written notice, at least 
14 days before the date of the sale, stating and demanding payment 
of that amount. 
(d) 
The Board may do anything necessary or desirable under the ASX Settlement 
Operating Rules to protect any lien, charge or other right to which the company 
is entitled under this constitution or a law. 
(e) 
When the company registers a transfer of shares on which the company has a 
lien without giving the transferee notice of its claim, the companys lien is 
released so far as it relates to amounts owing by the transferor or any 
predecessor in title. 
(f) 
The Board may: 
(1) 
exempt a share from all or part of this rule 3.6; and 
(2) 
waive or compromise all or part of any payment due to the company 
under this rule 3.6. 
3.7 
Surrender of shares 
(a) 
The Board may accept a surrender of a share by way of compromise of a claim. 
(b) 
Any share so surrendered may be sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of in the 
same manner as a forfeited share. 
3.8 
Sale, reissue or other disposal of shares by the company 
(a) 
A reference in this rule 3.8 to a sale of a share by the company is a reference to 
any sale, reissue or other disposal of a share under rule 3.4(f) or, rule 3.6(c) or 
rule 5.4. 
(b) 
When the company sells a share, the Board may: 
(1) 
receive the purchase money or consideration given for the share; 
(2) 
effect a transfer of the share or execute or appoint a person to 
execute, on behalf of the former holder, a transfer of the share; and 
(3) 
register as the holder of the share the person to whom the share is 
sold. 
(c) 
A person to whom the company sells shares need not take any steps to 
investigate the regularity or validity of the sale, or to see how the purchase 
money or consideration on the sale is applied. That persons title to the shares 
is not affected by any irregularity by the company in relation to the sale. A sale 
of the share by the company is valid even if a Transmission Event occurs to the 
member before the sale.

(d) 
The only remedy of a person who suffers a loss because of a sale of a share by 
the company is a claim for damages against the company. 
(e) 
The proceeds of a sale of shares by the company must be applied in paying: 
(1) 
first, the expenses of the sale; 
(2) 
secondly, all amounts payable (whether presently or not) by the 
former holder to the company, 
and any balance must be paid to the former holder on the former holder 
delivering to the company proof of title to the shares acceptable to the Board. 
(f) 
The proceeds of sale arising from a written notice under rule 5.4(b) must not be 
applied in payment of the expenses of the sale and must be paid to the former 
holder on the former holder delivering to the company proof of title to the shares 
acceptable to the Board. 
(g) 
Until the proceeds of a sale of a share sold by the company are claimed or 
otherwise disposed of according to law, the Board may invest or use the 
proceeds in any other way for the benefit of the company. 
(h) 
The company is not required to pay interest on money payable to a former 
holder under this rule 3.8. 
(i) 
On completion of a sale, reissue or other disposal of a share under rule 3.4(f), 
the rights which attach to the share which were extinguished under rule 3.4(h) 
revive. 
(j) 
A written statement by a director or secretary of the company that a share in the 
company has been: 
(1) 
duly forfeited under rule 3.4(b); 
(2) 
duly sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of under rule 3.4(f); or 
(3) 
duly sold under rule 3.6(c) or rule 5.4, 
on a date stated in the statement is conclusive evidence of the facts stated as 
against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share, and of the right of the 
company to forfeit, sell, reissue or otherwise dispose of the share.

Interest payable by member 
(a) 
For the purposes of rules 3.1(h)(1), 3.4(g)(2) and 3.5(b)(3), the rate of interest 
payable to the company is: 
(1) 
if the Board has fixed a rate, that rate; or 
(2) 
in any other case, a rate per annum 2% higher than the rate

Interest accrues daily and may be capitalised monthly or at such other intervals 
the Board decides.

(a) 
The Board may pay any dividends that, in its judgment, the financial position of 
the company justifies. 
(b) 
The Board may rescind a decision to pay a dividend if it decides, before the 
payment date, that the companys financial position no longer justifies the 
payment or that it is otherwise in the best interests of the company that the 
dividend decision be rescinded. 
(c) 
The Board may pay any dividend required to be paid under the terms of issue of 
a share. 
(d) 
Paying a dividend does not require confirmation at a general meeting. 
(e) 
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares: 
(1) 
all dividends must be paid equally on all shares, except that a partly 
paid share confers an entitlement only to the proportion of the 
dividend which the amount paid (not credited) on the share is of the 
total amounts paid and payable (excluding amounts credited); 
(2) 
for the purposes of rule 4.1(e)(1), unless the Board decides otherwise, 
an amount paid on a share in advance of a call is to be taken as not 
having been paid until it becomes payable; and 
(3) 
interest is not payable by the company on any dividend. 
(f) 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, the Board may fix a record 
date for a dividend, with or without suspending the registration of transfers from 
that date under rule 5.3. 
(g) 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, a dividend in respect of a share 
must be paid to the person who is registered, or entitled under rule 5.1(c) to be 
registered, as the holder of the share: 
(1) 
where the Board has fixed a record date in respect of the dividend, on 
that date; or 
(2) 
where the Board has not fixed a record date in respect of that 
dividend, on the date fixed for payment of the dividend, 
and a transfer of a share that is not registered, or left with the company for 
registration under rule 5.1(b), on or before that date is not effective, as against 
the company, to pass any right to the dividend. 
(h) 
When resolving to pay a dividend, the Board may direct payment of the dividend 
from any available source permitted by law, including: 
(1) 
wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets, including paid-up 
shares or other securities of the company or of another body 
corporate, either generally or to specific members; and 
(2) 
unless prevented by the Listing Rules, to particular members wholly or 
partly out of any particular fund or reserve or out of profits derived 
from any particular source, and to the other members wholly or partly 
out of any other particular fund or reserve or out of profits derived from 
any other particular source. 
(i) 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, where a person is entitled to a 
share because of a Transmission Event, the Board may, but need not, retain 
any dividends payable on that share until that person becomes registered as 
the holder of that share or transfers it.

(j) 
The Board may retain from any dividend payable to a member any amount 
presently payable by the member to the company and apply the amount 
retained to the amount owing. 
(k) 
The Board may decide the method of payment of any dividend or other amount 
in respect of a share. Different methods of payment may apply to different 
members or groups of members (such as overseas members). Without limiting 
any other method of payment which the company may adopt, payment in 
respect of a share may be made: 
(1) 
by such electronic or other means approved by the Board directly to 
an account (of a type approved by the Board) nominated in writing by 
the member or the joint holders; or 
(2) 
by cheque sent to the address of the member shown in the register of 
members or, in the case of joint holders, to the address shown in the 
register of members of any of the joint holders, or to such other 
address as the member or any of the joint holders in writing direct. 
(l) 
A cheque sent under rule 4.1(k):  
(1) 
may be made payable to bearer or to the order of the member to 
whom it is sent or any other person the member directs; and  
(2) 
is sent at the member's risk. 
(m) 
If the Board decides that payments will be made by electronic transfer into an 
account (of a type approved by the Board) nominated by a member, but no 
such account is nominated by the member or an electronic transfer into a 
nominated account is rejected or refunded, the company may credit the amount 
payable to an account of the company to be held until the member nominates a 
valid account. 
(n) 
Where a member does not have a registered address or the company believes 
that a member is not known at the members registered address, the company 
may credit an amount payable in respect of the members shares to an account 
of the company to be held until the member claims the amount payable or 
nominates a valid account. 
(o) 
An amount credited to an account under rules 4.1(m) or 4.1(n) is to be treated 
as having been paid to the member at the time it is credited to that account. The 
company will not be a trustee of the money and no interest will accrue on the 
money. The money may be used for the benefit of the company until claimed, 
reinvested under rule 4.1(p) or disposed of in accordance with the laws relating 
to unclaimed monies. 
(p) 
If a cheque for an amount payable under rule 4.1(k) is not presented for 
payment for at least 11 calendar months after issue or an amount is held in an 
account under rules 4.1(m) or 4.1(n) for at least 11 calendar months, the Board 
may reinvest the amount, after deducting reasonable expenses, into shares in 
the company on behalf of, and in the name of, the member concerned and may 
stop payment on the cheque. The shares may be acquired on market or by way 
of new issue at a price the Board accepts is market price at the time. Any 
residual sum which arises from the reinvestment may be carried forward or 
donated to charity on behalf of the member, as the Board decides. The 
companys liability to provide the relevant amount is discharged by an 
application under this rule 4.1(p). The Board may do anything necessary or 
desirable (including executing any document) on behalf of the member to effect 
the application of an amount under this rule 4.1(p). The Board may determine 
other rules to regulate the operation of this rule 4.1(p) and may delegate its 
power under this rule to any person.

4.2 
Capitalising profits 
(a) 
Subject to:  
(1) 
the Listing Rules;  
(2) 
any rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares; 
and  
(3) 
any special resolution of the company,  
the Board may capitalise and distribute to members, in the same proportions as 
the members are entitled to receive dividends, any amount: 
(4) 
forming part of the undivided profits of the company; 
(5) 
representing profits arising from an ascertained accretion to capital or 
a revaluation of the assets of the company; 
(6) 
arising from the realisation of any assets of the company; or 
(7) 
otherwise available for distribution as a dividend. 
(b) 
The Board may resolve that all or any part of the capitalised amount is to be 
applied: 
(1) 
in paying up in full, at an issue price decided by the Board, any 
unissued shares in or other securities of the company; 
(2) 
in paying up any amounts unpaid on shares or other securities held by 
the members;  
(3) 
partly as specified in rule 4.2(b)(1) and partly as specified in 
rule 4.2(b)(2); or 
(4) 
any other method permitted by law. 
The members entitled to share in the distribution must accept that application in 
full satisfaction of their interest in the capitalised amount. 
(c) 
Rules 4.1(e), 4.1(f) and 4.1(g) apply, so far as they can and with any necessary 
changes, to capitalising an amount under this rule 4.2 as if references in those 
rules to: 
(1) 
a dividend were references to capitalising an amount; and 
(2) 
a record date were references to the date the Board resolves to 
capitalise the amount under this rule 4.2. 
(d) 
Where the terms of options (existing at the date the resolution referred to in 
rule 4.2(b) is passed) entitle the holder to an issue of bonus shares under this 
rule 4.2, the Board may in determining the number of unissued shares to be so 
issued, allow in an appropriate manner for the future issue of bonus shares to 
options holders. 
4.3 
Ancillary powers 
(a) 
To give effect to any resolution to reduce the capital of the company, to satisfy a 
dividend as set out in rule 4.1(h)(1) or to capitalise any amount under rule 4.2, 
the Board may settle as it thinks expedient any difficulty that arises in making 
the distribution or capitalisation and, in particular: 
(1) 
make cash payments in cases where members are entitled to 
fractions of shares or other securities;  
For personal use only
 
 
 
      
 
 
 
Constitution for Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
Contents 21 
 
(2) 
decide that amounts or fractions of less than a particular value 
decided by the Board may be disregarded to adjust the rights of all 
parties; 
(3) 
fix the value for distribution of any specific assets; 
(4) 
pay cash or issue shares or other securities to any member to adjust 
the rights of all parties; 
(5) 
vest any of those specific assets, cash, shares or other securities in a 
trustee on trust for the persons entitled to the distribution or 
capitalised amount; and 
(6) 
authorise any person to make, on behalf of all the members entitled to 
any specific assets, cash, shares or other securities as a result of the 
distribution or capitalisation, an agreement with the company or 
another person which provides, as appropriate, for the distribution or 
issue to them of shares or other securities credited as fully paid up or 
for payment by the company on their behalf of the amounts or any 
part of the amounts remaining unpaid on their existing shares or other 
securities by applying their respective proportions of the amount 
resolved to be distributed or capitalised. 
(b) 
Any agreement made under an authority referred to in rule 4.3(a)(6) is effective 
and binds all members concerned. 
(c) 
If a distribution, transfer or issue of specific assets, shares or securities to a 
particular member or members is, in the Boards discretion, considered 
impracticable or would give rise to parcels of securities that do not constitute a 
marketable parcel, the Board may make a cash payment to those members or 
allocate the assets, shares or securities to a trustee to be sold on behalf of, and 
for the benefit of, those members, instead of making the distribution, transfer or 
issue to those members. Any proceeds receivable by members under this rule 
4.3(c) will be net of expenses incurred by the company and trustee in selling the 
relevant assets, shares or securities. 
(d) 
If the company distributes to members (either generally or to specific members) 
securities in the company or in another body corporate or trust (whether as a 
dividend or otherwise and whether or not for value), each of those members 
appoints the company as his or her agent to do anything needed to give effect 
to that distribution, including agreeing to become a member of that other body 
corporate. 
4.4 
Reserves 
(a) 
The Board may set aside out of the companys profits any reserves or 
provisions it decides. 
(b) 
The Board may appropriate to the companys profits any amount previously set 
aside as a reserve or provision. 
(c) 
Setting aside an amount as a reserve or provision does not require the Board to 
keep the amount separate from the companys other assets or prevent the 
amount being used in the companys business or being invested as the Board 
decides.

Carrying forward profits 
The Board may carry forward any part of the profits remaining that they consider should 
not be distributed as dividends or capitalised, without transferring those profits to a 
reserve or provision.

Transfer and transmission of shares 
5.1 
Transferring shares 
(a) 
Subject to this constitution and to any restrictions attached to a members 
shares, a member may transfer any of the members shares by: 
(1) 
a Proper ASTC Transfer; or 
(2) 
a written transfer in any usual form or in any other form approved by 
the Board. 
(b) 
A transfer referred to in rule 5.1(a)(2) must be: 
(1) 
signed by or on behalf of the transferor and, if required by the 
company, the transferee; 
(2) 
if required by law, duly stamped; and 
(3) 
left for registration at the companys registered office, or at any other 
place the Board decides, with such evidence the Board requires to 
prove the transferors title or right to the shares and the transferees 
right to be registered as the owner of the shares. 
(c) 
Subject to rules 5.2(a) and 5.3, where the company receives a transfer 
complying with rule 5.1, the company must register the transferee named in the 
transfer as the holder of the shares to which it relates. 
(d) 
A transferor of shares remains the holder of the shares until a Proper ASTC 
Transfer has been effected or the transferees name is entered in the register of 
members as the holder of the shares. 
(e) 
The company must not charge a fee for registering a transfer of shares unless: 
(1) 
the company is not listed on the Exchange; or 
(2) 
the fee is permitted by the Listing Rules. 
(f) 
The company (or the companys securities registry) may put in place, and 
require compliance with, reasonable processes and procedures in connection 
with determining the authenticity of an instrument of transfer, notwithstanding 
that this may prevent, delay or interfere with the registration of the relevant 
instrument of transfer.  
(g) 
The company may retain a registered transfer for any period the Board decides. 
(h) 
The Board may do anything that is necessary or desirable for the company to 
participate in any computerised, electronic or other system for facilitating the 
transfer of shares or operation of the companys registers that may be owned, 
operated or sponsored by the Exchange or a related body corporate of the 
Exchange.

(i) 
The Board may, to the extent the law permits, waive any of the requirements of 
this rule 5.1 and prescribe alternative requirements instead, to give effect to 
rule 5.1(h) or for another purpose. 
5.2 
Power to decline to register transfers 
(a) 
The Board may decline to register, or prevent registration of, a transfer of 
shares or apply a holding lock to prevent a transfer in accordance with the Act 
or the Listing Rules where: 
(1) 
the transfer is not in registrable form; 
(2) 
the company has a lien on any of the shares transferred; 
(3) 
registration of the transfer may breach a law of Australia; 
(4) 
the transfer is paper-based and registration of the transfer will result in 
a holding which, at the time the transfer is lodged, is less than a 
marketable parcel; 
(5) 
the transfer is not permitted under the terms of an employee share 
plan; or 
(6) 
the company is otherwise permitted or required to do so under the 
Listing Rules or, except for a Proper ASTC Transfer, under the terms 
of issue of the shares. 
(b) 
If the Board declines to register a transfer, the company must give notice of the 
refusal as required by the Act and the Listing Rules. Failure to give that notice 
will not invalidate the decision of the Board to decline to register the transfer. 
(c) 
The Board may delegate its authority under this rule 5.2 to any person. 
5.3 
Power to suspend registration of transfers 
The Board may suspend the registration of transfers at any time, and for any periods, 
permitted by the ASX Settlement Operating Rules that it decides. 
5.4 
Selling non marketable parcels 
(a) 
The Board may sell shares that constitute less than a marketable parcel by 
following the procedures in this rule 5.4. 
(b) 
The Board may send a written notice to a member who holds less than a 
marketable parcel of shares in a class of shares of the company, on a date 
decided by the Board, which: 
(1) 
explains the effect of the notice under this rule 5.4; and 
(2) 
advises the holder that he or she may choose to be exempt from the 
provisions of this rule. A form of election for that purpose must be sent 
with the notice. 
(c) 
If, before 5.00pm Sydney time on a date specified in the notice which is no 
earlier than 6 weeks after the notice is sent: 
(1) 
the company has not received a notice from the member exempting 
them from this rule 5.4; and 
(2) 
the member has not increased his or her shareholding to a marketable 
parcel, 
For personal use only
 
 
 
      
 
 
 
Constitution for Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
Contents 24 
 
the member is taken to have irrevocably appointed the company as his or her 
agent to do anything in rule 5.4(e). 
(d) 
In addition to initiating a sale by sending a notice under rule 5.4(b), the Board 
may also initiate a sale if a member holds less than a marketable parcel and 
that holding was created by a transfer of a parcel of shares effected on or after 
1 September 1999 that was less than a marketable parcel at the time that the 
transfer document was initiated or, in the case of a paper-based transfer 
document, was lodged with the company. In that case: 
(1) 
the member is taken to have irrevocably appointed the company as 
his or her agent to do anything in rule 5.4(e); and 
(2) 
if the holding was created after 26 October 2000, the Board may 
remove or change the members rights to vote or receive dividends in 
respect of those shares. Any dividends withheld must be sent to the 
former holder after the sale when the former holder delivers to the 
company such proof of title as the Board accepts. 
(e) 
The company may: 
(1) 
sell the shares constituting less than a marketable parcel as soon as 
practicable; 
(2) 
deal with the proceeds of sale under rule 3.8; and 
(3) 
receive any disclosure document, including a financial services guide, 
as agent for the member. 
(f) 
The costs and expenses of any sale of shares arising from a notice under 
rule 5.4(b) (including brokerage and stamp duty) are payable by the purchaser 
or by the company. 
(g) 
A notice under rule 5.4(b) may be given to a member only once in a 12 month 
period and may not be given during the offer period of a takeover bid for the 
company. 
(h) 
If a takeover bid is announced after a notice is given but before an agreement is 
entered into for the sale of shares, this rule ceases to operate for those shares. 
However, despite rule 5.4(g), a new notice under rule 5.4(b) may be given after 
the offer period of the takeover bid closes. 
(i) 
The Board may, before a sale is effected under this rule 5.4, revoke a notice 
given or suspend or terminate the operation of this rule either generally or in 
specific cases. 
(j) 
If a member is registered in respect of more than one parcel of shares, the 
Board may treat the member as a separate member in respect of each of those 
parcels so that this rule 5.4 will operate as if each parcel was held by different 
persons. 
5.5 
Transmission of shares 
(a) 
Subject to rule 5.5(c), where a member dies, the only persons the company will 
recognise as having any title to the members shares or any benefits accruing 
on those shares are: 
(1) 
where the deceased was a sole holder, the legal personal 
representative of the deceased; and 
(2) 
where the deceased was a joint holder, the survivor or survivors. 
For personal use only

Contents 25 
 
(b) 
Rule 5.5(a) does not release the estate of a deceased member from any liability 
on a share, whether that share was held by the deceased solely or jointly with 
other persons. 
(c) 
The Board may register a transfer of shares signed by a member before a 
Transmission Event even though the company has notice of the Transmission 
Event. 
(d) 
A person who becomes entitled to a share because of a Transmission Event 
may, on producing such evidence as the Board requires to prove that persons 
entitlement to the share, choose: 
(1) 
to be registered as the holder of the share by signing and giving the 
company a written notice stating that choice; or 
(2) 
to nominate some other person to be registered as the transferee of 
the share by executing or effecting in some other way a transfer of the 
share to that other person. 
(e) 
The provisions of this constitution concerning the right to transfer shares and 
the registration of transfers of shares apply, so far as they can and with any 
necessary changes, to a notice or transfer under rule 5.5(d) as if the relevant 
Transmission Event had not occurred and the notice or transfer were executed 
or effected by the registered holder of the share. 
(f) 
Where 2 or more persons are jointly entitled to a share because of a 
Transmission Event they will, on being registered as the holders of the share, 
be taken to hold the share as joint tenants and rule 2.6 will apply to them.

General meetings 
6.1 
Calling general meetings 
(a) 
A general meeting may only be called: 
(1) 
by a Board resolution; or 
(2) 
as otherwise provided in the Act. 
(b) 
The Board may, by notice to the Exchange, change the venue for, postpone or 
cancel a general meeting, but: 
(1) 
a meeting that is called in accordance with a members requisition 
under the Act; and 
(2) 
any other meeting that is not called by a Board resolution. 
may not be postponed or cancelled without the prior written consent of the 
persons who called or requisitioned the meeting. 
6.2 
Notice of general meetings 
(a) 
Notice of a general meeting must be given to each person who at the time of 
giving the notice: 
(1)

(b) 
The content of a notice of a general meeting called by the Board is to be 
decided by the Board, but it must state the general nature of the business to be 
transacted at the meeting and any other matters required by the Act. 
(c) 
Unless the Act provides otherwise: 
(1) 
no business may be transacted at a general meeting unless the 
general nature of the business is stated in the notice calling the 
meeting; and 
(2) 
except with the approval of the Board or the chairperson, no person 
may move any amendment to a proposed resolution or to a document 
that relates to such a resolution. 
(d) 
A person may waive notice of any general meeting by written notice to the 
company. 
(e) 
Failure to give a member or any other person notice of a general meeting or a 
proxy form, does not invalidate anything done or any resolution passed at the 
general meeting if: 
(1) 
the failure occurred by accident or inadvertent error; or 
(2) 
before or after the meeting, the person notifies the company of the 
persons agreement to that thing or resolution. 
(f) 
A persons attendance at a general meeting waives any objection that person 
may have to: 
(1) 
a failure to give notice, or the giving of a defective notice, of the 
meeting unless the person at the beginning of the meeting objects to 
the holding of the meeting; and 
(2) 
the consideration of a particular matter at the meeting which is not 
within the business referred to in the notice of the meeting, unless the 
person objects to considering the matter when it is presented. 
6.3 
Admission to general meetings 
(a) 
The chairperson of a general meeting may take any action he or she considers 
appropriate for the safety of persons attending the meeting and the orderly 
conduct of the meeting and may refuse admission to, or require to leave and 
remain out of, the meeting any person: 
(1) 
 who refuses to comply with searches, restrictions or other security 
arrangements that the chairperson considers appropriate; 
(2) 
in possession of a pictorial-recording or sound-recording device; 
(3)

(8) 
who is not entitled to receive notice of the meeting. 
The chairperson may delegate the powers conferred by this rule to any person 
he or she thinks fit. 
(b) 
A person, whether a member or not, requested by the Board or the chairperson 
to attend a general meeting is entitled to be present and, at the request of the 
chairperson, to speak at the meeting. 
(c) 
If the chairperson of a general meeting considers that there is not enough room 
for the members who wish to attend the meeting, he or she may arrange for any 
person whom he or she considers cannot be seated in the main meeting room 
to observe or attend the general meeting in a separate room. Even if the 
members present in the separate room are not able to participate in the conduct 
of the meeting, the meeting will nevertheless be treated as validly held in the 
main room. 
(d) 
If a separate meeting place is linked to the main place of a general meeting by 
an instantaneous audio-visual communication device which, by itself or in 
conjunction with other arrangements: 
(1) 
gives the general body of members in the separate meeting place a 
reasonable opportunity to participate in proceedings in the main place; 
and 
(2) 
enables the members in the separate meeting place to vote on a poll, 
a member present at the separate meeting place is taken to be present at the 
general meeting and entitled to exercise all rights as if he or she was present at 
the main place. 
(e) 
If, before or during the meeting, any technical difficulty occurs where one or 
more of the matters set out in rule 6.3(d) is not satisfied, the chairperson may: 
(1) 
adjourn the meeting until the difficulty is remedied; or 
(2) 
continue to hold the meeting in the main place (and any other place 
which is linked under rule 6.3(d)) and transact business, and no 
member may object to the meeting being held or continuing. 
(f) 
Nothing in this rule 6.3 or in rule 6.6 is to be taken to limit the powers conferred 
on the chairperson by law. 
6.4 
Quorum at general meetings 
(a) 
No business may be transacted at a general meeting, except the election of a 
chairperson and the adjournment of the meeting, unless a quorum of members 
is present when the meeting proceeds to business. 
(b) 
A quorum is 5 or more members present at the meeting and entitled to vote on 
a resolution at the meeting. 
(c) 
If a quorum is not present within 30 minutes after the time appointed for the 
general meeting: 
(1) 
where the meeting was called at the request of members, the meeting 
must be dissolved; or 
(2) 
in any other case, the meeting stands adjourned to the day, time and 
place the directors present decide or, if they do not make a decision, 
to the same day in the next week at the same time and place. If a 
quorum is not present at the adjourned meeting within 30 minutes

6.5 
Chairperson of general meetings 
(a) 
The chairperson of the Board or, in the absence of the chairperson, the deputy 
chairperson of the Board is entitled, if present within 15 minutes after the time 
appointed for a general meeting and willing to act, to preside as chairperson at 
the meeting. 
(b) 
The directors present may choose one of their number to preside as 
chairperson if, at a general meeting: 
(1) 
there is no chairperson or deputy chairperson of the Board; 
(2) 
neither the chairperson nor the deputy chairperson of the Board is 
present within 15 minutes after the time appointed for the meeting; or 
(3) 
neither the chairperson nor the deputy chairperson of the Board is 
willing to act as chairperson of the meeting. 
(c) 
If the directors do not choose a chairperson under rule 6.5(b), the members 
present must elect as chairperson of the meeting: 
(1) 
another director who is present and willing to act; or 
(2) 
if no other director is present and willing to act, a member who is 
present and willing to act. 
(d) 
A chairperson of a general meeting may, for any item of business or discrete 
part of the meeting, vacate the chair in favour of another person nominated by 
him or her (Acting Chairperson). Where an instrument of proxy appoints the 
chairperson as proxy for part of the proceedings for which an Acting 
Chairperson has been nominated, the instrument of proxy is taken to be in 
favour of the Acting Chairperson for the relevant part of the proceedings. 
(e) 
Wherever the term chairperson is used in this rule 6, it is to be read as a 
reference to the chairperson of the general meeting, unless the context 
indicates otherwise. 
6.6 
Conduct at general meetings 
(a) 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the chairperson is responsible for the 
general conduct of the meeting and for the procedures to be adopted at the 
meeting. 
(b) 
The chairperson may, at any time the chairperson considers it necessary or 
desirable for the efficient and orderly conduct of the meeting: 
(1) 
impose a limit on the time that a person may speak on each motion or 
other item of business and terminate debate or discussion on any 
business, question, motion or resolution being considered by the 
meeting and require the business, question, motion or resolution to be 
put to a vote of the members present;  
(2) 
adopt any procedures for casting or recording votes at the meeting 
whether on a show of hands or on a poll, including the appointment of 
scrutineers; and 
(3) 
decide not to put to the meeting any resolution proposed in the notice 
convening the meeting (other than a resolution proposed by members

Contents 29 
 
in accordance with the Act or required by the Act to be put to the 
meeting). 
(c) 
A decision by a chairperson under rules 6.6(a) or 6.6(b) is final. 
(d) 
Whether or not a quorum is present, the chairperson may postpone the meeting 
before it has started, if, at the time and place appointed for the meeting, he or 
she considers that: 
(1) 
there is not enough room for the number of members who wish to 
attend the meeting; or 
(2) 
a postponement is necessary in light of the behaviour of persons 
present or for any other reason so that the business of the meeting 
can be properly carried out. 
(e) 
A postponement under rule 6.6(d) will be to another time, which may be on the 
same day as the meeting, and may be to another place (and the new time and 
place will be taken to be the time and place for the meeting as if specified in the 
notice that called the meeting originally). 
(f) 
The chairperson may at any time during the course of the meeting: 
(1) 
adjourn the meeting or any business, motion, question or resolution 
being considered or remaining to be considered by the meeting either 
to a later time at the same meeting or to an adjourned meeting; and 
(2) 
for the purpose of allowing any poll to be taken or determined, 
suspend the proceedings of the meeting for such period or periods as 
he or she decides without effecting an adjournment. No business may 
be transacted and no discussion may take place during any 
suspension of proceedings unless the chairperson otherwise allows. 
(g) 
The chairpersons rights under rules 6.6(d) and 6.6(f) are exclusive and, unless 
the chairperson requires otherwise, no vote may be taken or demanded by the 
members present concerning any postponement, adjournment or suspension of 
proceedings. 
(h) 
Only unfinished business may be transacted at a meeting resumed after an 
adjournment. 
(i) 
Where a meeting is postponed or adjourned under this rule 6.6, notice of the 
postponed or adjourned meeting must be given to the Exchange, but, except as 
provided by rule 6.6(k), need not be given to any other person. 
(j) 
Where a meeting is postponed or adjourned, the Board may, by notice to the 
Exchange, postpone, cancel or change the place of the postponed or adjourned 
meeting. 
(k) 
Where a meeting is postponed or adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the 
postponed or adjourned meeting must be given as in the case of the original 
meeting. 
6.7 
Decisions at general meetings 
(a) 
Except where a resolution requires a special majority, questions arising at a 
general meeting must be decided by a majority of votes cast by the members 
present at the meeting. A decision made in this way is for all purposes, a 
decision of the members. 
(b) 
If the votes are equal on a proposed resolution, the chairperson of the meeting 
has a casting vote, in addition to any deliberative vote.

(c) 
Subject to rule 6.7(d), each motion submitted to a general meeting is to be 
decided in the first instance by a show of hands of the members present and 
entitled to vote.  
(d) 
A matter will be decided on a poll without first being submitted to the meeting to 
be decided on a show of hands where: 
(1) 
the matter is a resolution set out in the notice of meeting provided to 
members in accordance with rule 6.2(a); or 
(2) 
any other circumstance where the chairperson determines it 
appropriate.  
(e) 
A poll may be demanded by members in accordance with the Act (and not 
otherwise) or by the chairperson.  
(f) 
A demand for a poll does not prevent a general meeting continuing to transact 
any business except the question on which the poll is demanded. 
(g) 
Unless a poll is duly demanded, a declaration by the chairperson that a 
resolution has on a show of hands been carried or carried unanimously, or 
carried by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in the book 
containing the minutes of the proceedings of the company is conclusive 
evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes 
recorded for or against the resolution. 
(h) 
A poll at a general meeting must be taken in the way and at the time the 
chairperson directs. The result of the poll as declared by the chairperson is the 
resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. 
(i) 
A poll cannot be demanded at a general meeting on the election of a 
chairperson. 
(j) 
The demand for a poll may be withdrawn with the chairpersons consent. 
6.8 
Direct voting 
(a) 
Despite anything to the contrary in this constitution, the Board may decide that, 
at any general meeting or class meeting, a member who is entitled to attend 
and vote on a resolution at that meeting is entitled to a direct vote in respect of 
that resolution. A direct vote includes a vote delivered to the company by post, 
fax or other electronic means approved by the Board. 
(b) 
The Board may prescribe regulations, rules and procedures in relation to direct 
voting, including specifying the form, method and timing of giving a direct vote 
at a meeting in order for the vote to be valid.  
6.9 
Voting rights 
(a) 
Subject to this constitution and the Act and to any rights or restrictions attached 
to any shares or class of shares, at a general meeting: 
(1) 
on a show of hands, every member present has one vote; and 
(2) 
on a poll, every member present has one vote for each share held as 
at the Record Time by the member entitling the member to vote, 
except for partly paid shares, each of which confers on a poll only the 
fraction of one vote which the amount paid (not credited) on the share 
bears to the total amounts paid and payable (excluding amounts 
credited) on the share. An amount paid in advance of a call is 
disregarded for this purpose.

(b) 
If a person present at a general meeting represents personally or by proxy, 
attorney or Representative more than one member, on a show of hands the 
person is, subject to the Act, entitled to one vote only even though he or she 
represents more than one member. 
(c) 
A joint holder may vote at a meeting either personally or by proxy, attorney or 
Representative as if that person was the sole holder. If more than one joint 
holder tenders a vote in respect of the relevant shares, the vote of the holder 
named first in the register who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, 
attorney or Representative, must be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of 
the other joint holders. 
(d) 
The parent or guardian of an infant member may vote at any general meeting 
on such evidence being produced of the relationship or of the appointment of 
the guardian as the Board may require and any vote so tendered by a parent or 
guardian of an infant member must be accepted to the exclusion of the vote of 
the infant member. 
(e) 
A person entitled to a share because of a Transmission Event may vote at a 
general meeting in respect of that share in the same way as if that person were 
the registered holder of the share if, at least 48 hours before the meeting (or 
such shorter time as the Board determines), the Board: 
(1) 
admitted that persons right to vote at that meeting in respect of the 
share; or 
(2) 
was satisfied of that persons right to be registered as the holder of, or 
to transfer, the share. 
Any vote duly tendered by that person must be accepted and the vote of the 
registered holder of those shares must not be counted. 
(f) 
Where a member holds a share on which a call or other amount payable to the 
company has not been duly paid: 
(1) 
that member is only entitled to be present at a general meeting and 
vote if that member holds, as at the Record Time, other shares on 
which no money is then due and payable; and 
(2) 
on a poll, that member is not entitled to vote in respect of that share 
but may vote in respect of any shares that member holds, as at the 
Record Time, on which no money is then due and payable. 
(g) 
A member is not entitled to vote on a resolution if, under the Act or the Listing 
Rules: 
(1) 
the member must not vote or must abstain from voting on the 
resolution; or 
(2) 
a vote on the resolution by the member must be disregarded for any 
purposes. 
If the member or a person acting as proxy, attorney or Representative of the 
member does tender a vote on that resolution, their vote must not be counted. 
(h) 
An objection to the validity of a vote tendered at a general meeting must be: 
(1) 
raised before or immediately after the result of the vote is declared; 
and 
(2) 
referred to the chairperson, whose decision is final. 
(i) 
A vote tendered, but not disallowed by the chairperson under rule 6.9(h), is valid 
for all purposes, even if it would not otherwise have been valid.

6.10 
Representation at general meetings 
(a) 
Subject to this constitution, each member entitled to vote at a general meeting 
may vote: 
(1) 
in person or, where a member is a body corporate, by its 
Representative; 
(2) 
by not more than 2 proxies; or 
(3) 
by not more than 2 attorneys. 
(b) 
A proxy, attorney or Representative may, but need not, be a member of the 
company. 
(c) 
An instrument appointing a proxy is valid if it is in accordance with the Act or in 
any form approved by the Board. 
(d) 
For the purposes of this rule 6.10 a proxy appointment received at an electronic 
address specified in the notice of general meeting for the receipt of proxy 
appointments or otherwise received by the company in accordance with the Act 
is taken to have been signed or executed if the appointment: 
(1) 
includes or is accompanied by a personal identification code allocated 
by the company to the member making the appointment; 
(2) 
has been authorised by the member in another manner approved by 
the Board and specified in or with the notice of meeting; or 
(3) 
is otherwise authenticated in accordance with the Act. 
(e) 
A vote given in accordance with an instrument appointing a proxy or attorney is 
valid despite the transfer of the share in respect of which the instrument was 
given if the transfer is not registered by the time at which the instrument 
appointing the proxy or attorney is required to be received under rule 6.10(i). 
(f) 
Unless otherwise provided in the appointment of a proxy, attorney or 
Representative, an appointment will be taken to confer authority: 
(1) 
even though the appointment may refer to specific resolutions and 
may direct the proxy, attorney or Representative how to vote on those 
resolutions, to do any of the acts specified in rule 6.10(g); and 
(2) 
even though the appointment may refer to a specific meeting to be 
held at a specified time or venue, where the meeting is rescheduled, 
adjourned or postponed to another time or changed to another venue, 
to attend and vote at the rescheduled, adjourned or postponed 
meeting or at the new venue. 
(g) 
The acts referred to in rule 6.10(f)(1) are: 
(1) 
to vote on any amendment moved to the proposed resolutions and on 
any motion that the proposed resolutions not be put or any similar 
motion; 
(2) 
to vote on any motion before the general meeting, whether or not the 
motion is referred to in the appointment; and 
(3) 
to act generally at the meeting (including to speak, demand a poll, join 
in demanding a poll and to move motions).

A proxy form issued by the company must allow for the insertion of the name of 
the person to be primarily appointed as proxy and may provide that, in 
circumstances and on conditions specified in the form that are not inconsistent 
with this constitution, the chairperson of the relevant meeting (or another person 
specified in the form) is appointed as proxy.  
(i) 
A proxy or attorney may not vote at a general meeting or adjourned or 
postponed meeting or on a poll unless the instrument appointing the proxy or 
attorney, and the authority under which the instrument is signed or a certified 
copy of the authority, are received by the company: 
(1) 
at least 48 hours, or such lesser time as specified by the Board in the 
notice of meeting, (or in the case of an adjournment or postponement 
of a meeting, any lesser time that the Board or the chairperson of the 
meeting decides) before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned 
or postponed meeting or taking the poll, as applicable; or 
(2) 
where rule 6.10(j)(2) applies, such shorter period before the time for 
holding the meeting or adjourned or postponed meeting or taking the 
poll, as applicable, as the company determines in its discretion. 
A document is received by the company under this rule 6.10(i) when it is 
received in accordance with the Act, and to the extent permitted by the Act, if 
the document is produced or the transmission of the document is otherwise 
verified to the company in the way specified in the notice of meeting. 
(j) 
Where the company receives an instrument recording a direct vote or 
appointing a proxy or attorney in accordance with this Constitution or the Act 
and within the time period specified in rule 6.10(i)(1) or as otherwise determined 
by the Board, the company is entitled to:  
(1) 
clarify with the relevant member any instruction in relation to that 
instrument by written or verbal communication and make any 
amendments to the instrument required to reflect any clarification; and 
(2) 
where the company considers that the instrument has not been duly 
executed, return the instrument to the appointing member and request 
that the member duly execute the instrument and return it to the 
company within the period determined by the company under rule 
6.10(i)(2) or otherwise determined by the Board and notified to the 
member.  
(k) 
The member is taken to have appointed the company as its attorney for the 
purpose of any amendments made to an instrument recording a direct vote or 
appointing a proxy or attorney in accordance with rule 6.10(j)(1). An instrument 
appointing a proxy or attorney which is received by the company in accordance 
with rule 6.10(j) is taken to have been validly received by the company. 
(l) 
The appointment of a proxy or attorney is not revoked by the appointor 
attending and taking part in the general meeting, but if the appointor votes on a 
resolution, the proxy or attorney is not entitled to vote, and must not vote, as the 
appointors proxy or attorney on the resolution. 
(m) 
Where a member appoints 2 proxies or attorneys to vote at the same general 
meeting: 
(1)

one proxy or attorney attends; and 
(3) 
on a poll, each proxy or attorney may only exercise votes in respect of 
those shares or voting rights the proxy or attorney represents. 
(n) 
Unless written notice of the matter has been received at the companys 
registered office (or at another place specified for lodging an appointment of a 
proxy, attorney or Representative for the meeting) within the time period 
specified under rules 6.10(i)(1) or 6.10(i)(2) (as applicable) a vote cast by a 
proxy, attorney or Representative is valid even if, before the vote is cast: 
(1)

Representative or revokes the authority under which a third party 
appointed the proxy, attorney or Representative.

Representative to establish to the chairpersons satisfaction that the person is 
the person duly appointed to act. If the person fails to satisfy the requirement, 
the chairperson may :

addition to the existing directors or to fill a casual vacancy, but so that the total 
number of directors does not exceed the maximum number fixed under this 
constitution.

(e) 
No director who is not the managing director may hold office without re-election 
beyond the third AGM following the meeting at which the director was last 
elected or re-elected. 
(f) 
If there is more than one managing director, only one of them, nominated by the 
Board, is entitled not to be subject to vacation of office under rule 7.1(d) or 
retirement under rule 7.1(e) or 7.1(g). 
(g) 
To the extent that the Listing Rules require an election of directors to be held 
and no director would otherwise be required (by rules 7.1(d) or 7.1(e)) to submit 
for election or re-election the director to retire is any director who wishes to 
retire (whether or not he or she intends to stand for re-election), otherwise it is 
the director who has been longest in office since their last election or 
appointment (excluding the managing director). As between directors who were 
last elected or appointed on the same day, the director to retire must be decided 
by lot (unless they can agree among themselves). 
(h) 
 A director is not required to retire and is not relieved from retiring because of a 
change in the number or identity of the directors after the date of the notice 
calling the AGM but before the meeting closes.

The members may by resolution at an annual general meeting appoint an 
eligible person to be a director, either as an addition to the existing directors or 
to fill a casual vacancy, but so that the total number of directors does not 
exceed the maximum number fixed under this constitution. 
(j) 
The retirement of a director from office under this constitution and the 
re-election of a director or the election of another person to that office (as the 
case may be) takes effect at the conclusion of the meeting at which the 
retirement and re-election or election occur. 
(k) 
A person is eligible for election to the office of a director at an annual general 
meeting only if: 
(1) 
the person is in office as a director immediately before that meeting 
and the Board has recommended the person's election to members; 
(2) 
the person has been nominated by the Board for election at that 
meeting; 
(3) 
where the person is a member, he or she has, within the timeframe 
specified in rule 7.1(l), given the company a notice signed by him or 
her stating the members desire to be a candidate for election at that 
meeting; or 
(4) 
where the person is not a member, a member intending to nominate 
the person for election at that meeting has, within the timeframe 
specified in rule 7.1(l), given the company a notice signed by the

arising from that office. 
(d) 
A contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the company in which 
a director is in any way interested is not invalid or voidable merely because the 
director holds office as a director or because of the fiduciary obligations arising 
from that office. 
(e) 
A director who is interested in any arrangement involving the company is not 
liable to account to the company for any profit realised under the arrangement

appointed, a director or other officer of that other corporation and, in that 
capacity, may be interested in the exercise of those voting rights.

outlined	in	that	section	include	risks	associated	with	PERLS	XII	specifically	and	risks	associated	with	CBAs	businesses	
which	may	affect	PERLS	XII,	including	those	summarised	below.	Many	of	these	risks	are	outside	the	control	of	CBA.
Further 
information
Page
Risks associated with PERLS XII specifically
PERLS XII are not 
deposit liabilities 
or protected 
accounts
Investments	in	PERLS	XII	are	an	investment	in	CBA	and	maybe	
affected	by	the	ongoing	performance,	financial	position	and	
solvency	of	CBA.	They	are	not	deposit	liabilities	or	protected	
accounts of CBA under the Banking Act.
Section	4.2.1
50
PERLS XII are 
subordinated and 
unsecured
PERLS	XII	are	subordinated	and	unsecured	liabilities.	In	a	winding	
up	of	CBA,	there	is	a	risk	that	you	may	lose	some	or	all	of	the	
money	you	invested	in	PERLS	XII.
Section	4.2.2	
50
Distributions may 
not be paid
Distributions	are	discretionary	and	subject	to	the	Distribution	
payment	conditions	being	satisfied.	Distributions	that	are	not	paid	
do	not	accrue	and	will	not	be	subsequently	paid.
Section	4.2.3	
50
PERLS XII may 
be Exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares
PERLS XII may be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares on the 
Mandatory	Exchange	Date	(subject	to	the	Maximum	Exchange	
Number and Mandatory Exchange Conditions) or on another date 
if	certain	events	occur.	This	includes	if	a	Capital	Trigger	Event,	Non-
Viability	Trigger	Event	or	Change	of	Control	Event	occurs.	There	
is	a	risk	that	on	Exchange	you	may	receive	a	number	of	Ordinary	
Shares	with	a	value	which	is	significantly	less	than	the	Face	Value,	
including as a result of the application of the Maximum Exchange 
Number and the market price for Ordinary Shares at the time.
Sections	4.2.4	 
and	4.2.5
51,
52
Ordinary 
Shares are a 
different type of 
investment to 
PERLS XII
Dividends	on	Ordinary	Shares	are	payable	at	the	absolute	
discretion	of	CBA	and	the	amount	of	each	dividend	is	discretionary	
(not	subject	to	a	formula).	In	a	winding	up	of	CBA,	claims	of	
holders of Ordinary Shares rank behind claims of holders of all 
other	securities	and	debts	of	CBA.	In	contrast,	Distributions	on	
PERLS	XII	are	payable	in	accordance	with	the	Terms	and	claims	of	
PERLS	XII	Holders	rank	ahead	of	holders	of	Ordinary	Shares.

A failure to 
Exchange 
following a 
Capital Trigger 
Event or  
Non-Viability 
Trigger Event may 
cause you to lose 
your investment
If	a	Capital	Trigger	Event	or	Non-Viability	Trigger	Event	occurs	
and Exchange fails to take effect for any reason and CBA has not 
otherwise	issued	the	Ordinary	Shares	required	to	be	issued	in	
respect	of	such	Exchange	within	5	Business	Days,	then	Holders	
rights	under	the	relevant	PERLS	XII	will	be	immediately	and	
irrevocably	terminated	and	such	termination	will	be	taken	to	have	
occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Capital 
Trigger	Event	or	Non-Viability	Trigger	Event.	Your	investment	in	
the	relevant	PERLS	XII	will	lose	all	of	its	value		the	Face	Value	
will	not	be	paid	and	you	will	not	receive	any	compensation.	This	
could	occur	if	CBA	was	prevented	from	issuing	Ordinary	Shares	
by	circumstances	outside	of	its	control,	for	example,	if	CBA	was	
prevented	by	an	applicable	law	or	order	of	any	court,	or	action	of	
any	government	authority,	from	issuing	Ordinary	Shares.

Rate will fluctuate
The	Distribution	Rate	will	fluctuate	with	changes	in	the	Market	
Rate.	It	is	possible	for	the	Market	Rate	to	become	negative.	
Should	this	occur,	the	negative	amount	will	be	taken	into	account	
in	calculating	the	Distribution	Rate.	There	is	a	risk	the	Distribution	
Rate	may	become	less	attractive	compared	to	returns	on	
comparable	securities	or	investments.
Section	4.2.10	
54
The market price 
of PERLS XII will

2.1.1 
How are Distributions calculated on PERLS XII?
Distribution Rate
The Distribution Rate is calculated using the following formula:
Distribution Rate =  
(Market Rate + Margin) x (1  Tax Rate)
Where
Market Rate is the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (BBSW) 
administered by ASX Benchmarks Pty Limited (or any other 
person that takes on the administration of that rate) expressed as 
a percentage per annum for a term of 3months. The Market Rate 
is the primary benchmark interest rate for the Australian money 
market. It is the primary short-term rate used in the financial 
markets for the pricing and valuation of Australian dollar securities 
and as a lending reference rate. The Market Rate changes to 
reflect supply and demand within the cash and currency markets 
and it is possible for the Market Rate to become negative. 
The Market Rate for each Distribution Period is set on the first 
Business Day of the Distribution Period.
Margin is 3.00% per annum.
Tax Rate is the Australian corporate tax rate on the relevant 
Distribution Payment Date.
Distributions are expected to be fully franked.
The first Distribution is scheduled to be paid on 15March2020.
Distributions are discretionary and subject to the Distribution 
payment conditions being satisfied. Distributions that are not paid 
do not accrue and will not be subsequently paid. Non-payment of 
a Distribution will not be an event of default and CBA will have no 
liability to Holders in respect of the unpaid Distribution.
If CBA determines that BBSW has been affected by a Market 
Rate Disruption Event, CBA may select an Alternative Market 
Rate that it considers appropriate and make other related 
changes to the Terms (subject to APRAs prior written approval in 
certain circumstances). Approval is at the discretion of APRA and 
may or may not be given.
Broadly, a Market Rate Disruption Event occurs where BBSW 
is not published by 10:30am (or any such time as CBA considers 
appropriate), there is an obvious error in the rate, BBSW has 
been discontinued or ceases to be calculated or administered, 
or BBSW has ceased to be generally accepted in the Australian 
market for securities such as PERLS XII. CBA is required to act in 
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in selecting 
an Alternative Market Rate, and may consult with sources that it 
considers appropriate, but may otherwise exercise its discretion.

Where an Alternative Market Rate applies, CBA retains a discretion 
to incorporate an adjustment (subject to APRAs written approval 
in certain circumstances), in order to reduce or eliminate, to the 
extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic 
prejudice or benefit to Holders as a result of the use of an 
Alternative Market Rate.
Further detail is set out in Clause 2.2 of the Terms.

This chart shows historical movements in the Market Rate. Past 
levels are not necessarily indicative of future levels.
It is possible for the Market Rate to become negative. Should 
this occur, the negative amount will be taken into account in 
calculating the Distribution Rate. For example, if the Market Rate 
is -1.00% per annum, the Margin is 3.00% per annum and the 
Australian corporate tax rate is 30%, then the Distribution Rate will 
be 1.40% per annum.
Calculation of 
Distributions
The Distribution payable on each PERLS XII for each Distribution 
Period is calculated using the following formula:
Distribution payable =
Distribution Rate x Face Value x Number of days in the 
Distribution Period / 365
For example, if the Face Value is A$100 (based on the Initial Face 
Value), the Market Rate is 0.84% per annum, the Margin is 3.00% 
per annum, the Australian corporate tax rate is 30% and the 
Distribution Period is 90days in length, the Distribution for the 
relevant Distribution Period would be calculated as follows:
3.84% x (1 - 30%) x A$100 x 90/365
= A$0.6628 per PERLS XII
This Distribution would be expected to be fully franked.
The above example is for illustrative purposes only and does not 
indicate, guarantee or forecast the actual Distribution Rate for any 
Distribution Period. The actual Distribution payable may be higher 
or lower than this example.
The Face Value used in this example is the Initial Face Value but 
the Face Value could be reduced if a Capital Trigger Event or 
Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs.

CBA will announce to ASX the applicable Distribution Rate and the 
amount of the Distribution payable for each Distribution Period. 
Information about the Distribution Rate can also be obtained 
from ASX at www.asx.com.au and from the Investor Centre at 
www.commbank.com.au/investors.
Franking credits
Distributions are expected to be fully franked.
If any Distribution is not fully franked for any reason, then that 
Distribution will be grossed up according to the formula in 
Clause2.4 of the Terms.
The ability for Holders to use franking credits, either as an offset 
to a tax liability or by claiming a refund, will depend on that Holders 
particular tax circumstance and any changes in Australian tax law.

No Distribution will be paid on Exchange where Exchange occurs 
due to a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-Viability Trigger Event.
Distributions that are not paid do not accrue and will not be 
subsequently paid. Non-payment of a Distribution on the relevant

CBA will have no liability to Holders in respect of the unpaid 
Distribution. However, from that Distribution Payment Date and 
until a Distribution is paid in full on a subsequent Distribution 
Payment Date (or all PERLS XII are Exchanged, Redeemed or

Early Redemption 
by CBA  for 
taxation reasons
A tax reason arises when:
 
as a result of a change in, or amendment to, the laws of 
Australia, or any change in their application or official or judicial 
interpretation or administration (including any announcement 
of a prospective change or amendment which has been or will 
be introduced), other than a change or amendment expected 
by CBA as at the Issue Date, there is a material risk that CBA 
would not be able to frank Distributions; or
 
CBA receives an opinion from reputable legal counsel or other 
tax adviser that there is a material risk that as a result of a 
change in, or amendment to, the laws of Australia, or any 
change in their application or official or judicial interpretation 
or administration (including any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or will be 
introduced), other than a change or amendment expected by 
CBA as at the Issue Date, CBA would be required to pay an 
increased amount under Clause9.6 of the Terms, or would be 
exposed to a more than de minimis adverse tax consequence 
in relation to PERLSXII.

treated as Tier1 Capital of the CBA Group under APRAs prudential 
standards as a result of a change in, or amendment to, the 
laws of Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards 
or guidelines, or any change in their application or official or 
judicial interpretation or administration (including following any

Exchange on 
the Mandatory 
Exchange Date
On the Mandatory Exchange Date (subject to the Maximum 
Exchange Number and Mandatory Exchange Conditions), you will 
receive for each of your PERLS XII a variable number of Ordinary 
Shares with a value equal to A$101.01 (based on the Initial Face 
Value and the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during the period of 
20Business Days before the Mandatory Exchange Date with the 
benefit of a 1%discount). The value of Ordinary Shares you receive 
could be less than this amount if the Face Value has previously 
been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event).
To realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you can sell them on 
ASX at the prevailing market price.

Exchange 
Number
CBA will issue to the Holder the Exchange Number of Ordinary 
Shares for each PERLS XII held by a Holder.
The Exchange Number is calculated according to the following 
formula, subject to the Exchange Number being no greater than 
the Maximum Exchange Number:
Face Value
0.99 x VWAP
Based on a Face Value of A$100 (the Initial Face Value) and with 
the benefit of the 1%discount, this means that you will receive a 
variable number of Ordinary Shares with a value equal to A$101.01. 
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less than this 
amount if the Face Value has previously been reduced (following a 
previous Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event).

Maximum 
Exchange 
Number
The number of Ordinary Shares that you will receive will not be 
greater than the Maximum Exchange Number which is calculated 
according to the following formula:
Face Value
Relevant Percentage x Issue Date VWAP
The Relevant Percentage is 0.50 if Exchange is occurring on a 
Mandatory Exchange Date.
The Issue Date VWAP is the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during 
the period of 20Business Days immediately preceding 
(but not including) the Issue Date for PERLS XII.
For example, if the Face Value is A$100 (based on the Initial Face 
Value) and the Issue Date VWAP is A$80, the Maximum Exchange 
Number would be calculated as follows:
A$100
(0.50 x A$80) 
= 2.5000 Ordinary Shares per PERLS XII
The Maximum Exchange Number may limit you to receiving 
a number of Ordinary Shares with a value (measured over the 
period prior to Exchange) which is significantly less than the 
Face Value on Exchange. To provide some protection for Holders 
against this occurring, Exchange on a Mandatory Exchange Date 
will not occur unless the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are 
satisfied.
However, depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth less than the 
Face Value, and may suffer loss as a consequence.
The Maximum Exchange Number will reduce if the Face Value 
has previously been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event).

VWAP
VWAP means the average of the daily volume weighted average 
prices of Ordinary Shares traded on ASX and Chi-X during the 
relevant period of 20Business Days, subject to adjustments.
It is intended to calculate a fair price of Ordinary Shares which is 
used to calculate the Exchange Number and Maximum Exchange 
Number.

Mandatory 
Exchange 
Conditions
Exchange will not occur unless all the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions are satisfied. If Exchange does not occur, you will 
continue to hold your PERLS XII until the first Distribution 
Payment Date after that date on which all the Mandatory 
Exchange Conditions are satisfied, at which time Exchange 
will occur.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions are:
 
First Mandatory Exchange Condition: the VWAP of Ordinary 
Shares on the 25thBusiness Day before (but not including) a 
potential Mandatory Exchange Date is greater than 56% of the 
Issue Date VWAP;
 
Second Mandatory Exchange Condition: the VWAP of 
Ordinary Shares during the period of 20Business Days before 
(but not including) a potential Mandatory Exchange Date is 
greater than 50.51% of the Issue Date VWAP; and
 
Third Mandatory Exchange Condition: Ordinary Shares 
are listed or admitted to trading on ASX as at the Mandatory 
Exchange Date.
The First and Second Mandatory Exchange Conditions are intended 
to provide some protection for Holders against Exchange occurring 
when the price of Ordinary Shares has fallen to such a level that 
you would only receive the Maximum Exchange Number.
CBA has had regard to market precedents and the cap on 
the number of Ordinary Shares permitted to be issued under 
applicable APRA prudential standards and ratings guidance in 
determining the percentages specified in the First and Second 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions.
The Third Mandatory Exchange Condition is intended to provide 
protection to Holders to enable them to sell the Ordinary Shares 
they receive on ASX if they wish to do so.
The following diagram illustrates the timeframes that are relevant 
for the Mandatory Exchange Conditions, using the date of 
20April2029 as a potential Mandatory Exchange Date. These 
dates are indicative only and may change.

What if I do

receive Ordinary 
Shares or if  
I am prohibited 
or restricted 
from receiving 
Ordinary Shares?
If you do not wish to receive Ordinary Shares, you can notify CBA 
of this at any time prior to the Exchange Date.
If Exchange occurs and you have notified CBA that you do not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares, or if you are an Ineligible Holder1, 
then CBA will issue the relevant number of Ordinary Shares to a 
Nominee who will hold the Ordinary Shares on trust for sale for 
your benefit2. At the first opportunity, the Nominee will arrange 
for the sale of the Ordinary Shares on your behalf and pay the 
proceeds less selling costs to you. No guarantee is given in relation 
to the timing or price at which any sale will occur.

Exchange  
general
CBA must Exchange all or some PERLS XII or a percentage of the 
Face Value of each PERLS XII in the following circumstances:
 
if a Capital Trigger Event occurs; or
 
if a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply.
On the Exchange Date (subject to the Maximum Exchange 
Number), you will receive for each of your PERLS XII a variable 
number of Ordinary Shares with a value equal to A$101.01 (based 
on the Initial Face Value of A$100 and the VWAP of Ordinary 
Shares with the benefit of a 1%discount). The VWAP is based on 
the period of 5Business Days before the Exchange Date.
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less than this 
amount if only a percentage of the Face Value is being Exchanged, 
if the Face Value has previously been reduced (following a 
previous Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event) or if 
the Maximum Exchange Number applies.
As a result of the application of the Maximum Exchange Number 
and depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth significantly 
less than A$101.01 per PERLS XII (based on an Initial Face Value of 
A$100), and may suffer a loss as a consequence.
To realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you can sell them on 
ASX at the prevailing market price.

 If, because the Holder is an Ineligible Holder, the Nominee is deemed to be an Ineligible Holder, then Ordinary Shares will be issued 
to the Nominee as soon as practicable after the Nominee ceases to be an Ineligible Holder. If Exchange is occurring because of the 
occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event, and the Exchange fails to take effect for any reason and CBA has 
not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in respect of such Exchange within 5 Business Days, then Holders 
rights under the relevant PERLS XII will be immediately and irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have 
occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event.

Capital Trigger 
Event
A Capital Trigger Event occurs when:
 
CBA determines; or
 
APRA notifies CBA in writing that it believes,
that either or both the CBA Level1 Common Equity Tier1 (CET1) 
Capital Ratio or CBA Level2 CET1 Capital Ratio is equal to or less 
than 5.125%.
The CET1 Capital Ratio is the ratio of CBAs CET1 Capital to its 
risk-weighted assets, where CET1 Capital is the strongest form of 
capital held by CBA. CBAs Level2 CET1 Capital Ratio was 10.7% 
as at 30June2019, which equates to a surplus of approximately 
A$23.2 billion above the Capital Trigger Event level of 5.125%.  
CBAs Level1 CET1 Capital Ratio was 11.2% as at 30June2019, 
which equates to a surplus of approximately A$25.7 billion above 
the Capital Trigger Event level of 5.125%.
If a Capital Trigger Event occurs, CBA must immediately Exchange 
such number of PERLS XII (or a percentage of the Face Value of 
each PERLS XII) as is sufficient to return the relevant CET1 Capital 
Ratio to above 5.125%.

Exchange of all or some PERLS XII (or the taking of an action 
in relation to other capital instruments of the CBA Group) is 
necessary because, without it, CBA would become non-viable; 
or
 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is 
necessary because, without it, CBA would become non-viable.
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, CBA must immediately 
Exchange such number of PERLS XII (or a percentage of the 
Face Value of each PERLS XII) as specified by APRA or necessary 
to satisfy APRA that CBA will no longer be non-viable. In the case 
of a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, all 
PERLS XII must be immediately Exchanged.

How does 
Exchange 
work upon the 
occurrence of a 
Capital Trigger 
Event or  
Non-Viability 
Trigger Event?
Upon the occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, CBA must immediately Exchange all or some PERLS 
XII (or a percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII). The 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply and the Terms 
provide that Exchange occurs automatically without the need for 
any further act or step by CBA and that CBA will recognise Holders 
as having been issued Ordinary Shares.
Any ASX trades in PERLS XII that have not settled on the date 
a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs 
will continue to settle in accordance with the normal ASX T+2 
settlement, although the seller will be treated as having delivered, 
and the buyer will be treated as having acquired, the number of 
Ordinary Shares into which PERLS XII have been Exchanged  
as a result of the occurrence of the Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event.
If Exchange fails to take effect for any reason and CBA has not 
otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in 
respect of such Exchange within 5Business Days, then Holders 
rights under the relevant PERLS XII will be immediately and 
irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have 
occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of the Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event. Your investment in 
the relevant PERLS XII will lose all of its value and you will not 
receive any compensation. This could occur if CBA is prevented 
from issuing Ordinary Shares by circumstances outside its control, 
for example, if CBA is prevented by a specified law or order of 
any court, or action of any government authority, from issuing 
Ordinary Shares.

Exchange 
Number
CBA will issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares for  
each PERLS XII held by a Holder.
The Exchange Number is calculated according to the same 
formula that applies to Exchange on the Mandatory Exchange 
Date (see Section 2.3 Mandatory Exchange), but with the VWAP 
based on the period of 5Business Days before the Exchange Date, 
and is subject to the Exchange Number being no greater than the 
Maximum Exchange Number.
The amount used as the Face Value in this calculation will 
only be the affected percentage of the Face Value required to 
be Exchanged and, if the full Face Value is not required to be 
Exchanged, you will continue to hold your PERLS XII with a 
reduced Face Value.

Maximum 
Exchange 
Number
The number of Ordinary Shares that you will receive will not be 
greater than the Maximum Exchange Number which is calculated 
according to the following formula:
Face Value
Relevant Percentage x Issue Date VWAP
The Relevant Percentage is 0.20 if a Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred.
The Issue Date VWAP is the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during 
the period of 20Business Days immediately preceding 
(but not including) the Issue Date for PERLS XII.
For example, if the Face Value is A$100 (based on the Initial Face 
Value) and the Issue Date VWAP is A$80, the Maximum Exchange 
Number would be calculated as follows:
A$100
(0.20 x A$80) 
= 6.2500 Ordinary Shares per PERLS XII
The Maximum Exchange Number may limit you to receiving a 
number of Ordinary Shares with a value which is significantly less 
than the Face Value.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply if a Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred.
As a result of the application of the Maximum Exchange Number 
and depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth significantly 
less than A$101.01 per PERLS XII (based on the Initial Face Value of 
A$100), and may suffer loss as a consequence.
The Maximum Exchange Number will reduce if the Face Value 
has previously been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event).

CBA must Exchange all PERLS XII if certain events occur.
Further 
information

Automatic early 
Exchange
CBA must Exchange all PERLS XII if a Change of Control Event 
occurs in respect of CBA.
A Change of Control Event occurs when:
 
a takeover bid for Ordinary Shares is made and certain 
conditions are satisfied; or
 
a scheme of arrangement is proposed and certain conditions 
are satisfied.
On the Exchange Date (subject to the Second and Third 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions and the Maximum Exchange 
Number, each as described below), you will receive for each of 
your PERLS XII a variable number of Ordinary Shares with a value 
equal to A$101.01 (based on the Initial Face Value of A$100 and 
the VWAP of Ordinary Shares with the benefit of a 1%discount). 
The VWAP will be based on the period of 20Business Days before 
the Exchange Date. The value of Ordinary Shares you receive 
could be less than this amount if the Face Value has previously 
been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event).
To realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you can sell them on 
ASX at the prevailing market price.

How does 
Exchange 
work upon the 
occurrence of a 
Change of  
Control Event?
Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Event, CBA must 
Exchange all PERLS XII. The Second and Third Mandatory 
Exchange Conditions will apply with the modifications in 
Clause4.7(c) of the Terms, as follows:
 
Second Mandatory Exchange Condition: the VWAP of 
Ordinary Shares during the period of 20Business Days before 
(but not including) the proposed Exchange Date is greater than 
20.20% of the Issue Date VWAP; and
 
Third Mandatory Exchange Condition: Ordinary Shares 
are listed or admitted to trading on ASX as at the proposed 
Exchange Date.

Exchange 
Number
CBA will issue to the Holder the Exchange Number of Ordinary

Maximum 
Exchange 
Number
The number of Ordinary Shares that you will receive will not be 
greater than the Maximum Exchange Number which is calculated 
according to the following formula:
Face Value
Relevant Percentage x Issue Date VWAP
The Relevant Percentage is 0.20 if a Change of Control Event has 
occurred.
The Issue Date VWAP is the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during 
the period of 20Business Days immediately preceding (but not 
including) the Issue Date for PERLS XII.
The Maximum Exchange Number may limit you to receiving 
a number of Ordinary Shares with a value (measured over the 
period prior to Exchange) which is significantly less than the 
Face Value on Exchange. To provide some protection for Holders 
against this occurring on Exchange due to a Change of Control 
Event, CBA will only Exchange PERLS XII due to a Change of 
Control Event where the Second and Third Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions are satisfied as modified by Clause4.7(c) of the Terms.
However, depending on the market price of Ordinary Shares at the 
time, you may receive Ordinary Shares that are worth less than the 
Face Value, and may suffer loss as a consequence.
The Maximum Exchange Number will reduce if the Face Value 
has previously been reduced (following a previous Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event).

Ranking in a 
winding up of 
CBA
Senior Ranking Obligations are all deposits and other liabilities, 
securities and other obligations of CBA (other than Equal Ranking 
Securities or Junior Ranking Securities). In a winding up of CBA, 
your claim will rank after the claims of holders of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, including creditors preferred by law and secured 
creditors.
Your claim will rank equally with claims of other Holders and 
holders of Equal Ranking Securities. This means your PERLS XII 
rank equivalently to a preference share.
Your claim will rank ahead of claims of holders of Junior Ranking 
Securities (being holders of Ordinary Shares).
On Exchange, Holders will become holders of Ordinary Shares and 
rank equally with other holders of Ordinary Shares and could lose 
all of their investment on a winding up of CBA.

Substitution
CBA may, in connection with a NOHC Event, without the consent 
of Holders but subject to APRA approval1, substitute a NOHC 
as the debtor under PERLS XII and as the issuer of ordinary 
shares on Exchange by giving notice to the Holders and ASX 
(Full Successor). Alternatively, CBA may substitute a NOHC 
only as the issuer of ordinary shares (Partial Successor). 
Any substitution is subject to the NOHC expressly assuming 
the relevant obligations of CBA under the Terms (including, 
in the instance of a Full Successor, the restrictions on paying 
Distributions and dividends on Ordinary Shares (with appropriate 
modifications)) and satisfying certain other conditions, including 
the quotation of the ordinary shares of the NOHC on a securities 
exchange. The substitution of a NOHC does not allow CBA to 
elect to Exchange PERLS XII nor does it give you a right to request 
Exchange of your PERLS XII.
Following substitution and prior to Exchange, you will continue 
to hold PERLS XII. The NOHC will be required to deliver its own 
ordinary shares in all circumstances when CBA would otherwise 
have been required to deliver Ordinary Shares (including on 
Exchange) and to use reasonable endeavours to procure the 
quotation of those ordinary shares on the relevant securities 
exchange.

Deed Poll
CBA has elected not to appoint a trustee in connection with  
PERLS XII. Instead, a Deed Poll has been made by CBA in favour 
of each person who is from time to time a Holder.
The PERLS XII Deed Poll contains: 
 
the agreement of CBA to observe its obligations as set out  
in the Terms;
 
an obligation on CBA to appoint the Registry and procure the 
Registry to establish and maintain a PERLS XII Register; and
 
provisions for meetings of Holders.
Holders will be bound by the terms of the Deed Poll, the Terms 
and this Prospectus when PERLS XII are allotted or transferred to 
them or they purchase PERLS XII.
The Registry will be responsible to hold the original executed 
Deed Poll on behalf of Holders. Each Holder can enforce

Business strategy of CBA 
CBAs	purpose	is	to	improve	the	financial	wellbeing	of	
its	customers	and	communities.	CBAs	purpose	provides	
clear	direction	to	its	people	and	guides	its	strategy.	
CBAs	strategy	is	to	become	a	simpler,	better	bank	that	
delivers	balanced	and	sustainable	outcomes	for	its	
customers,	community,	its	people	and	shareholders.	CBA	
has	set	three	execution	priorities:	simplify	the	business;	
lead	in	retail	and	commercial	banking;	and	best	in	digital.	
CBA	believes	these	priorities	best	leverage	its	competitive	
advantages	and	positions	it	for	success.
To	deliver	on	the	strategy,	CBA	is	investing	in	four	
critical	capabilities:	operational	risk	and	compliance;	cost	
reduction;	data	and	analytics;	and	innovation.	These	
capabilities	address	CBAs	operating	context	and	best	
support	performance	into	the	future.	
Most	importantly,	the	goal	of	the	strategy	is	to	deliver	
balanced	and	sustainable	outcomes	for	CBAs	stakeholders.

scrutiny	on	the	Australian	financial	services	industry,	and	
CBA	has	been	involved	in	a	number	of	regulatory,	legal	
and	industry	reviews.	This	and	the	extensive	regulation	
CBA	is	subject	to	poses	regulatory	and	reputational	
challenges	for	CBA.	
CBA	aims	to	earn	the	trust	of	its	customers,	regulators	
and	the	community,	and	is	seeking	to	ensure	it	does	
not	make	mistakes	which	might	undermine	trust	in	the	
future.	
The	risks	to	CBAs	business	from	regulatory	matters,	
litigation	and	reputational	damage	are	outlined	in	
Sections	4.3.1	CBA	is	subject	to	extensive	regulation	
and	operates	in	an	environment	of	political	scrutiny,	
which	could	adversely	impact	its	operations	and	financial	
condition	and	4.3.2	CBA	may	be	adversely	affected	by	
damage	to	its	reputation	and	4.3.11	CBAs	business	could	
be	negatively	impacted	by	substantial	legal	liability	or	
regulatory	action.Examples	of	some	current	matters	are	
described	below.
(i)	 APRA	Prudential	Inquiry	into	CBA
The	Panel	appointed	by	APRA	to	conduct	the	
independent	prudential	inquiry	into	CBA	published	its	
final	report	on	1May2018	(APRA Report).	The	APRA	
Report	makes	a	number	of	findings	regarding	the	
complex	interplay	of	organisational	and	cultural	factors	
within	the	CBA	Group	and	the	need	for	enhanced	
management	of	non-financial	risks.	In	response	to	
the	APRA	Report,	the	CBA	Group	has	acknowledged	
that	it	will	implement	all	of	the	recommendations	
and	has	agreed	to	adjust	its	minimum	operational	
risk	capital	requirements	by	an	additional	A$1billion	
(risk-weighted	assets	A$12.5billion),	until	such	time	
as	the	recommendations	are	implemented	to	APRAs	
satisfaction.
CBA	has	entered	into	an	Enforceable	Undertaking	
under	which	CBAs	remedial	action	(Remedial 
Action Plan)	in	response	to	the	APRA	Report	would	
be	agreed	and	regularly	monitored	by	APRA.	The	
Remedial	Action	Plan	provides	a	detailed	program	
of	change	outlining	how	CBA	will	improve	the	
way	it	runs	its	business,	manages	risk	and	works	
with	regulators.	The	Remedial	Action	Plan	also	
provides	a	comprehensive	assurance	framework,	
with	Promontory	Australasia	(Sydney)	Pty	Ltd	
(Promontory)	having	been	appointed	as	the	
independent	reviewer	and	who	is	required	to	report	to	
APRA	on	the	CBA	Groups	progress	against	committed	
milestones	every	3	months.	
As	at	30June2019,	Promontory	has	submitted	
four	reports	which	have	been	publicly	released	
by	CBA.	Promontory	has	noted	that	the	Remedial	
Action	Plan	program	of	work	remains	on	track	and	
CBAs	commitment	to	implementing	the	APRAs	
recommendations	in	a	timely	and	comprehensive	
way	continued	to	be	strong	with	all	156	milestones	on	
schedule	to	be	delivered	by	the	due	date.

Information About CBA (continued)
Section 3
As	at	30June2019,	CBA	submitted	a	total	of	
75	milestones	to	Promontory	for	assessment.
The	CBA	Group	has	provided	for	costs	associated	with	
the	implementation	of	the	Remedial	Action	Plan.
(ii)	AUSTRAC	and	related	proceedings
In	October	2017,	CBA	was	served	with	a	shareholder	
class	action	proceeding	filed	in	the	Federal	Court	
of	Australia	alleging	breaches	of	CBAs	continuous	
disclosure	obligations	and	misleading	and	
deceptive	conduct	in	relation	to	the	subject	matter	
of	the	civil	penalty	proceedings	brought	by	the	
Australian	Transaction	Reports	and	Analysis	Centre	
(AUSTRAC).	The	AUSTRAC	proceedings	concerned	
contraventions	of	the	Anti-Money	Laundering	and	
Counter	Terrorism	Financing	Act	2006	(Cth)	(AML/
CTF Act).	The	resolution	of	the	proceedings	was	
approved	by	the	Federal	Court	on	20June2018	with	
CBA	paying	a	penalty	of	A$700million	and	legal	costs.	
In	the	shareholder	class	action,	it	is	alleged	that	CBA	
shareholders	who	acquired	an	interest	in	CBA	shares	
between	1	July	2015	and	3	August	2017	suffered	loss	
caused	by	the	alleged	conduct.
On	29June2018,	a	similar	second	shareholder	class	
action	in	relation	to	the	matter	of	the	AUSTRAC	
proceedings	was	served	on	CBA	on	behalf	of	certain	
CBA	shareholders	who	acquired	an	interest	in	CBA	
shares	between	16	June	2014	and	3	August	2017.	On	
10July2019,	court	orders	were	made	confirming	the	
two	class	action	proceedings	would	continue	and	
would	be	case	managed	together	and	proceed	by	way	
of	one	harmonised	statement	of	claim.
It	is	currently	not	possible	to	determine	the	ultimate	
impact	of	these	claims,	if	any,	on	the	CBA	Group.	The	
CBA	Group	denies	the	allegations	and	continues	to	
defend	both	claims.	The	CBA	Group	has	provided	for	
legal	costs	expected	to	be	incurred	in	the	defence	of	
the	claims.	
(iii)	The	Royal	Commission
The	Royal	Commission	was	established	on	
14	December	2017	and	was	authorised	to	inquire	into	
misconduct	by	financial	service	entities	(including	
CBA).	Seven	rounds	of	hearings	into	misconduct	
in	the	banking	and	financial	services	industry	were	
held	throughout	2018,	covering	a	variety	of	topics	
including	consumers	and	business	lending,	financial	
advice,	superannuation,	insurance	and	policy	round.	
The	Royal	Commissions	final	report	was	delivered	on	
1February2019.	The	final	report	included	76	policy	
recommendations	to	the	Australian	Government	and	
findings	in	relation	to	the	case	studies	investigated	
during	hearings,	with	a	number	of	referrals	being	
made	to	regulators	for	misconduct	by	financial	
institutions,	which	is	expected	to	result	in	heightened	
levels	of	enforcement	action	across	the	industry.
The	76	recommendations	covered	many	of	CBAs	
business	areas	and	also	canvassed	the	role	of	
the	regulators	and	the	approach	to	be	taken	to	
customer	focus,	culture	and	remuneration.	The	
recommendations	regarding	the	role	of	regulators	
and	their	approach	to	enforcement	may	increase	
enforcement	activity,	costs	and	reputational	impact	
for	financial	institutions.	CBA	released	a	statement	
to	the	ASX	on	8March2019	welcoming	the	final	
report	and	committing	to	actions	to	deliver	the	
recommendations.	The	Government	has	accepted	 
75	of	the	76	recommendations.
(iv)	Other	industry-wide	regulatory	reforms	and	political	
developments
Other	industry-wide	regulatory	reforms	and	political	
developments	include	the	comprehensive	credit	
reporting	and	open	banking	regimes,	the	Banking	
Executive	Accountability	Regime	which	took	effect	
from	1July2018,	and	the	new	Banking	Code	of	Practice	
approved	by	ASIC	which	took	effect	from	1July2019.
Further	detail	on	the	matters	described	in	this	 
Section	3.4	and	other	updates	on	legal,	regulatory	and	
industry	levels	are	included	in	the	2019Annual	Report	
and	Note	7.1	to	the	Financial	Statements	in	the	Profit	
Announcement	and	for	the	full	year	ended	30June2019.

3.8.1 Capital adequacy
3.8.1.1 Capital generally
CBA	is	an	ADI	regulated	by	APRA	and	other	regulatory	
bodies.	APRA	generally	follows	the	principles	for	banking	
supervision	developed	by	the	Basel	Committee	on	
Banking	Supervision	(BCBS).
Under	the	principles	known	as	Basel	I,	Basel	II	and	
Basel	III,	an	ADI	is	currently	required	to	hold	a	certain	
level	of	regulatory	capital	against	its	risk-weighted	assets	
(RWA)	in	order	for	such	capital	to	absorb	losses	which	
an	ADI	may	incur	from	time	to	time,	and	therefore	protect	
depositors	from	realising	such	losses.
CET1	Capital	comprises	ordinary	share	capital,	retained	
earnings	and	certain	other	items	recognised	as	capital,	
less	prescribed	deductions.	The	ratio	of	such	capital	to	
RWA	is	called	the	CET1	Capital	Ratio.
Tier	1	Capital	comprises	CET1	Capital	plus	certain	
equity-like	securities	(such	as	PERLS	XII).	The	ratio	of	
such	capital	to	RWA	is	called	the	Tier	1	Capital	ratio.
Tier	2	Capital	comprises	certain	securities	having	features	
eligible	to	be	recognised	as	Tier	2	Capital.
The	strongest	and	most	loss	absorbent	form	of	capital	
is	CET1	Capital,	followed	by	other	Tier	1	Capital	and	then	
Tier	2	Capital.
The	sum	of	Tier	1	Capital	and	Tier	2	Capital	is	called	Total	
Capital.	The	ratio	of	Total	Capital	to	RWA	is	called	the	
Total	Capital	ratio.
Generally,	higher	capital	ratios	indicate	an	ADIs	financial	
strength	which	is	critical	to	the	ADIs	ability	to	refinance	
its	debt,	including	Tier	1	securities	such	as	PERLS	XII	in	
the	future.

Information About CBA (continued)
Section 3
Under	Basel	III,	an	ADI	is	required	to	have	a	minimum	
CET1	Capital	Ratio	of	4.5%	which	applies	to	both	the	
ADIs	Level	1	Group	and	Level	2	Group.	APRA	may	also	
determine	that	an	Australian	bank	is	required	to	hold	an	
additional	amount	of	capital	above	the	4.5%	minimum	
requirement,	and	the	total	of	the	4.5%	minimum	
requirement	and	any	additional	amount	required	is	called	
the	prudential	capital	requirement	(PCR).	CBA	has	held	
capital	at	levels	above	these	minimums	and	intends	to	
hold	capital	above	these	minimums	in	the	future.
An	ADI	is	required	to	maintain	a	capital	conservation	
buffer	(CCB)	in	the	form	of	CET1	Capital	equal	to	2.5%	
of	RWA,	unless	APRA	determines	otherwise.	
For	domestic	systemically	important	banks	(D-SIB),	such	
as	CBA,	APRA	currently	requires	a	1%	D-SIB	buffer,	raising	
the	CCB	to	at	least	3.5%.	This	makes	the	total	CET1	Capital	
requirement	for	a	D-SIB	equal	to	a	minimum	of	8%.	
APRA	also	has	the	discretion	to	apply	an	additional	
countercyclical	capital	buffer	to	all	banks	with	an	
indicative	range	of	between	0%	and	2.5%	of	CET1	Capital.	
If	applicable,	this	forms	part	of	the	CCB.	APRA	has	
currently	set	the	countercyclical	capital	buffer	applicable	
to	Australian	exposures	at	0%.
References	to	the	minimum	total	CET1	Capital	
requirement	applicable	under	APRAs	prudential	
standards	are	to	general	minimums	applying	under	
the	APRA	prudential	standards,	rather	than	specific	
minimums	applying	to	CBA.
In	addition,	the	Leverage	Ratio	will	act	as	a	supplementary	
measure	to	the	other	capital	requirements	and	is	defined	
as	an	ADIs	Tier	1	Capital	divided	by	that	ADIs	total	
exposures	(on	and	off	balance	sheet	exposures).

As	at	30June2019,	CBAs	Level	2	CET1	Capital	Ratio	was	10.7%,	this	means	that,	for	every	A$1of	RWA	it	had,	it	held	
A$0.107	of	capital	in	the	form	of	CET1	Capital.

3.8.1.2 Capital Trigger Event
Under	Basel	III,	Tier	1	securities	(such	as	PERLS	XII)	must	include	a	Capital	Trigger	Event.
A	Capital	Trigger	Event	may	occur	if	either	or	both	the	CBA	Level	1	CET1	Capital	Ratio	or	CBA	Level	2	CET1	Capital	Ratio	
as	calculated	under	APRAs	approach	is	equal	to	or	less	than	5.125%	(see	Section	4.2.5	A	Capital	Trigger	Event	or	 
Non-Viability	Trigger	Event	may	occur).	CBA	has	held	CET1	Capital	at	levels	above	5.125%	and	intends	to	hold	capital	
above	this	level	in	the	future.

Includes	the	CCB.
CBAs	Level	1	CET1	Capital	Ratio	was	11.2%	as	
at	30June2019,	which	equates	to	a	surplus	of	
approximately	A$13.6billion	above	the	minimum	CET1	
Capital	requirement.
As	outlined	above,	discretionary	payments	(such	as	
Distributions	on	PERLS	XII)	may	not	be	paid	if	an	ADIs	
CET1	Capital	Ratio	falls	into	the	CCB.	Distributions	that	are	
not	paid	do	not	accrue	and	will	not	be	subsequently	paid.	
3.8.1.4 Leverage Ratio
The	Leverage	Ratio	represents	the	amount	of	Tier	1	
Capital	the	CBA	Level	2	Group	holds	against	its	exposures.	
This	is	a	supplementary	measure	to	the	other	capital	
requirements.	Such	capital	absorbs	losses	which	CBA	
may	incur	from	time	to	time	and	protects	depositors	from	
realising	such	losses.	Generally,	a	higher	leverage	ratio	
indicates	CBAs	financial	strength	which	is	critical	to	CBAs	
ability	to	refinance	its	debt,	including	PERLS	XII	in	the	
future.
As	at	30June2019,	CBAs	Leverage	Ratio	was	5.6%.	This	
means	that,	for	every	A$1	of	exposures	it	had,	it	held	
A$0.056	of	capital	in	the	form	of	Tier	1	Capital.
3.8.1.5 Regulatory developments 
APRA	has	implemented	a	number	of	actions	in	response	
to	the	Financial	System	Inquiry	(FSI)	Final	Report	of	
December	2014,	including	the	reports	recommendation	
that	Australian	ADIs	be	required	to	operate	with	
unquestionably	strong	capital	ratios.
In	July	2017,	APRA	released	an	information	paper	
Strengthening	banking	system	resilience		establishing	
unquestionably	strong	capital	ratios	in	relation	to	
establishing	the	quantum	of	capital	required	for	the	
Australian	banking	sector	to	have	capital	ratios	that	are	
unquestionably	strong.	APRA	stated	in	the	paper	that	
in	order	to	meet	the	objective	of	having	unquestionably	
strong	capital	ratios,	Australias	major	banks	would	need	
to	operate	with	an	average	benchmark	ratio	of	CET1	
Capital	to	RWA	of	10.5%	or	more	by	1	January	2020.
Separately,	on	7	December	2017,	the	BCBS	finalised	the	
Basel	III	bank	capital	framework	Basel	III:	Finalising	
post-crisis	reforms	confirming	new	measures	designed	
to	address	deficiencies	in	the	international	regulatory	
capital	framework	following	the	global	financial	crisis,	
primarily	focused	on	addressing	excessive	variability	in	
RWA,	and	therefore	capital	requirements,	across	banks.
In	response,	on	14	February	2018,	APRA	released	a	
discussion	paper	titled	Discussion	Paper		Revisions	
to	the	capital	framework	for	authorised	deposit-taking	
institutions	(Capital Framework Discussion Paper) 
to	commence	its	consultation	on	revisions	to	the	capital	
framework.	The	Capital	Framework	Discussion	Paper	
outlines	the	main	components	of	the	revisions	APRA	
expects	to	make	to	the	risk-based	capital	requirements	
for	ADIs	using	the	advanced	and	standardised	approach	
to	credit,	market	and	operational	risk.	APRA	has	since	
released	draft	prudential	standards	on	the	standardised	
approach	to	measuring	credit	and	operational	risk.	
In	addition,	APRA	has	proposed	a	simpler	method	
for	calculating	capital	requirements	for	residential	
mortgages	measured	under	the	internal	ratings	based	
(IRB)	approach.	APRA	has	also	released	a	consultation	
paper	on	Prudential	Standard	111	Capital Adequacy: 
Measurement of Capital	(APS111).
Amongst	other	things,	the	Capital	Framework	Discussion	
Paper	seeks	to	address	systemic	concentration	of	ADI	
portfolios	in	residential	mortgages	and	the	proposals	
seek	to	target	higher-risk	residential	mortgage	lending,	
including	investment	and	interest	only	loans.
APRA	has	stated	that	it	expects	the	overall	impact	of	
the	proposals	in	the	Capital	Framework	Discussion	
Paper	to	be	a	net	increase	in	ADIs	RWA.	APRA	has	
noted	that	all	else	being	equal,	this	will	reduce	an	ADIs	
reported	capital	ratios,	even	though	there	is	no	change	
to	the	ADIs	underlying	risk	profile	or	to	the	quantum	
of	capital	required	to	achieve	capital	ratios	that	are	
unquestionably	strong.
In	August2018,	APRA	released	a	second	discussion	paper	
titled	Discussion	paper		Improving	the	transparency,	
comparability	and	flexibility	of	the	ADI	capital	framework	
(Transparency, Comparability and Flexibility 
Discussion Paper).	APRA	proposes	two	key	approaches	
for	achieving	comparability,	without	changing	the	
quantum	or	allocation	of	capital.

The	first	approach	is	similar	to	current	practices,	but	
would	result	in	two	APRA-endorsed	capital	ratios.	ADIs	
would	continue	to	determine	regulatory	capital	ratios	
using	APRAs	definitions	of	capital	and	RWA,	and	this	
ratio	would	be	compared	to	minimum	requirements.	
A	second	capital	ratio	would	also	be	calculated	and	
disclosed	in	accordance	with	a	prescribed	APRA	
methodology.	APRA	proposes	that	this	second	
ratio	is	a	disclosure-only	capital	ratio,	primarily	for	
international	comparison.	
 
The	second	approach	will	result	in	only	one	set	
of	APRA	regulatory	capital	ratios	that	are	more	
internationally	harmonised	than	the	current	
approach,	or	the	first	approach.	This	will	be	achieved	
by	removing	certain	aspects	of	APRAs	relative	
conservatisms	from	an	ADIs	capital	ratio	calculations	
and	lifting	minimum	regulatory	capital	ratio	
requirements	in	tandem.	This	may	be	achieved	via	a	
capital	overlay	at	each	tier	of	capital	(CET1,	Tier	1	and	
Total	Capital).	APRA	has	noted	that	adoption	of	this	
approach	would	need	to	consider	the	alteration	of	the	
loss	absorption	trigger	point	of	5.125%	for	Tier	1	Capital	
securities	(such	as	PERLS	XII).
The	outcome	of	these	discussion	papers,	and	the	
overall	review	of	the	capital	framework,	will	determine	
whether	APRA	may	recalibrate	the	benchmark	10.5%	
CET1	Capital	Ratio	applicable	to	major	banks.	However,	
APRAs	expectation	is	that	any	change	will	not	necessitate	
additional	capital	raisings	by	ADIs	nor	alter	the	risk	
sensitivity	of	capital	requirements.	APRAs	intention	is	that	
the	quantum	of	capital	required	to	be	held	by	ADIs	under	
the	revised	capital	framework	can	be	accommodated	
within	the	amount	of	capital	they	would	have	needed	to	
hold	to	meet	the	10.5%	benchmark	CET1	Capital	Ratio	by	
January2020.	
Revisions	to	APRAs	prudential	standards	will	be	subject	
to	consultation	before	becoming	effective	from	1	January	
2021	for	operational	risk	and	from	1	January	2022	for	all	
other	reforms.	This	implementation	timeframe	is	also	
subject	to	consultation.	
Consistent	with	CBAs	approach	to	capital	management,	
CBA	intends	to	maintain	unquestionably	strong	capital	
ratios	through	a	range	of	initiatives,	including	organic	
capital	generation,	a	focus	on	financial	strength	and	
announced	asset	sales	(see	Section	3.8.1.6	CBAs	
approach	to	capital	management	and	Section	3.2	
Businesses	of	CBA).
In	addition	to	the	revisions	to	the	capital	framework,	
APRA	is	implementing	other	capital	related	FSI	
recommendations,	including	a	framework	for	minimum	
loss-absorbing	and	recapitalisation	capacity	and	the	
introduction	of	a	minimum	Leverage	Ratio	requirement	
for	ADIs.	
On	14February2018,	APRA	released	a	discussion	paper	
titled	Discussion	Paper		Leverage	ratio	requirements	
for	authorised	deposit-taking	institutions	(Leverage 
Ratio Discussion Paper).	Following	consultation,	in	
November2018,	APRA	announced	that	it	would	set	a	
minimum	Leverage	Ratio	requirement	of	3.5%	for	IRB	
ADIs,	including	CBA,	which	will	apply	from	1	January2022.	
On	9July2019,	APRA	released	its	response	to	the	
submissions	for	the	November	2018	discussion	paper	
titled	Discussion	Paper		increasing	the	loss-absorbing	
capacity	(LAC)	of	ADIs	to	support	orderly	resolution,	
APRA	confirmed	that	the	Australian	LAC	regime	will	be	
established	under	the	existing	capital	framework.	For	
D-SIBs,	including	CBA,	APRA	will	require	an	increase	in	
the	Total	Capital	requirement	by	3%	of	RWA,	effective	
1	January	2024.	APRA	further	noted	that	its	long	term	
target	of	4%	to	5%	of	LAC	remains	unchanged	and	it	
will	consider	feasible	alternative	methods	for	raising	
the	additional	1%	to	2%	over	the	next	four	years,	in	
consultation	with	industry	and	other	stakeholders.	
The	Reserve	Bank	of	New	Zealand	is	undertaking	a	
comprehensive	review	of	the	capital	adequacy	framework	
applying	to	registered	banks	in	New	Zealand.	The	latest	
consultation	paper	titled	Capital	Review	Paper	4:	How	
much	capital	is	enough?	released	in	December2018	
includes	proposals	to	increase	New	Zealand	IRB	banks	
RWA	to	90%	of	standardised	RWA	and	to	increase	
the	minimum	Tier	1	capital	requirement	for	banks	
which	are	deemed	systemically	important	to	16%	of	
RWA	(currently	8.5%).	Consultation	on	the	proposals	
is	now	closed	with	final	policy	decisions	expected	in	
November2019.	If	implemented	as	proposed,	these	
reforms	may	result	in	an	increase	in	CBAs	investment	
in	ASB.	However,	the	potential	capital	increase	is	not	
expected	to	impact	reported	CET1	Capital	Ratios	for	the	
CBA	Group	and	is	manageable	at	the	CBA	Parent	Bank	
level.	Sufficient	capacity	exists	under	APRAs	new	reduced	
limits	for	ADIs	exposures	to	related	entities,	including	for	
the	additional	capital	requirement	proposed	by	the	RBNZ.

3.8.1.6 CBAs approach to capital management
CBA	conservatively	but	proactively	manages	its	capital	
position	to	avoid	breaching	the	minimum	capital	
requirements	and	to	ensure	it	has	sufficient	capital	to	
manage	future	growth.	The	Board	and	management	are	
responsible	for	the	setting	of	internal	capital	minimums	
and	targets	to	ensure	that	CBAs	capital	is	prudently	above	
APRAs	minimum	capital	requirements.	
CBA	also	conducts	internal	assessments	of	the	
appropriate	level	of	capital	to	hold,	and	regularly	
stress-tests	various	scenarios	to	ensure	that	it	holds	
sufficient	capital	to	withstand	such	stresses.	It	takes	into	
consideration	the	level	of	capital	held	by	peer	banks,	both	
domestic	and	global.
CBA	issues	securities	such	as	PERLS	XII	to	satisfy	its	
Tier1	Capital	requirements	and	provide	flexibility	for	
future	growth.
Further information about CBAs approach to capital 
management can be found in the section entitled

3.8.2 Funding and liquidity
3.8.2.1 Funding
CBA	raises	customer	deposits	as	well	as	long-term	and	
short-term	wholesale	debt	to	fund	its	business	activities,	
including	lending.	Customer	deposits	include	transaction,	
savings	and	investment	deposits	raised	from	retail,	
business	and	institutional	clients,	predominantly	in	
Australia.	Long-term	and	short-term	wholesale	debt	are	
raised	both	in	Australia	and	overseas.	CBA	conservatively	
but	proactively	manages	the	amount,	tenor	and	mix	of	its	
funding	to	ensure	it	has	sufficient	funding	for	its	current	
business	activities	and	to	manage	future	growth.
It	also	manages	its	wholesale	debt	maturities	to	ensure	
that	it	is	able	to	repay	or	refinance	its	liabilities	when	they	
fall	due.
Under	APRAs	liquidity	prudential	standard,	CBA	is	
required	to	comply	with	a	Net	Stable	Funding	Ratio	
(NSFR)	requirement	to	have	sufficient	stable	funding	
held	against	core	assets.	APRA	prescribed	factors	are	
used	to	determine	the	stable	funding	requirement	of	
assets	and	the	stability	of	funding.	Under	APRAs	liquidity	
prudential	standard,	CBA	must	maintain	an	NSFR	of	at	
least	100%.	
As	at	30June2019,	CBAs	NSFR	was	112%.	This	means	
that,	for	every	A$1	of	core	assets,	it	held	A$1.12	of	stable	
funding.

3.8.2.2 Liquidity
CBA	ensures	that	it	has	sufficient	cash,	liquid	assets	
(marketable	securities	and	repo-eligible	securities)	to	
ensure	that	it	is	able	to	repay	its	short	term	liabilities,	
including	repaying	deposits,	when	they	fall	due.
Under	APRAs	liquidity	prudential	standard,	CBA	is	
required	to	comply	with	a	Liquidity	Coverage	Ratio	
(LCR)	requirement	to	hold	sufficient	liquid	assets	to	
cover	net	cash	outflows	projected	under	a	30	day	stress	
scenario.	Under	APRAs	liquidity	prudential	standard,	CBA	
must	maintain	an	LCR	of	at	least	100%.
As	at	30June2019,	CBAs	quarterly	average	LCR	was	
132%.	This	means	that,	for	every	A$1	of	potential	net	cash	
outflow,	it	held	A$1.32	of	liquid	assets.

3.8.3  Explanation of CBAs 
revenue model
CBAs	banking	businesses	primarily	earn	their	revenue	
from	the	interest	and	fees	charged	for	loans.	Some	
banking	businesses,	such	as	Institutional	Banking	and	
Markets,	earn	fees	for	services	performed	for	customers.
The	funds	administration	businesses	earn	fees	for	
funds	administration	and	advice	services	performed	for	
customers.
The	insurance	businesses	earn	premiums	in	relation	to	
general	insurance	provided	to	customers.	Part	of	those	
premiums	are	invested	in	anticipation	of	future	liabilities	
and	therefore	the	revenue	of	these	businesses	also	
includes	investment	earnings.
The	below	two	ratios	are	examples	of	ratios	that	measure	
the	performance	of	CBAs	businesses:	
 
Operating expense to total operating income ratio
The	operating	expense	to	total	operating	income	ratio	
represents	CBAs	operating	expenses	as	a	percentage	
of	total	operating	income.	All	else	being	equal,	a	lower	
operating	expense	to	total	operating	income	ratio	
indicates	that	more	total	operating	income	may	be	
available	to	pay	Distributions.
For	the	twelve	months	to	30June2019,	CBAs	
operating	expense	to	total	operating	income	ratio	
(cash basis)	was	46.2%.	This	means	that,	for	every	
A$1	of	operating	income	it	earned,	it	had	operating	
expenses	of	A$0.462.
 
Return on equity ratio
The	return	on	equity	ratio	represents	CBAs	net	profit	
after	tax	as	a	percentage	of	its	average	shareholders	
equity.	Generally,	a	higher	return	on	equity	ratio	
indicates	that	more	profit	may	be	available	to	pay	
Distributions.
For	the	twelve	months	to	30June2019,	CBAs	return	
on	equity	ratio	(cash basis)	was	12.5%.	This	means	
that,	for	every	A$1	of	shareholders	equity	it	held,	it	
earned	net	profit	after	tax	of	A$0.125.

3.8.6 Summary of financial ratios
The	ASIC	Guidance	suggests	some	financial	ratios	which	may	assist	you	to	determine	a	companys	financial	capacity	
to	pay	interest,	and	repay	the	face	value,	on	a	bond.	CBA	does	not	calculate	these	ratios	as	they	would	not	provide	
meaningful	assistance	given	the	nature	of	CBAs	business	which	is	different	to	companies	outside	the	financial	services	
industry.	Nevertheless,	CBA	calculates	the	ratios	set	out	in	the	following	table	which	may	provide	assistance.	
See	Sections	3.8.1	Capital	adequacy,	3.8.2	Funding	and	liquidity	and	3.8.3	Explanation	of	CBAs	revenue	model	for	
detailed	explanations	of	these	ratios.

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes
50
4.1 
Introduction
There are risks which could affect an investment in PERLS 
XII, including:
 
risks associated with PERLS XII specifically, many of 
which are outside the control of CBA; and
 
risks associated with CBAs businesses which may 
affect PERLS XII.
All principal or material risks and uncertainties that have 
been identified by CBA as at the date of this Prospectus 
are included in this section. Additional risks and 
uncertainties that CBA is unaware of, or that it currently 
deems to be immaterial, may also become important risk 
factors that affect CBA and therefore PERLS XII. This list 
of risks is not exhaustive. CBA is subject to continuous 
disclosure obligations, requiring new material information 
to be announced to the ASX.
If any of the listed or unlisted risks actually occur, CBAs 
business operations, financial condition or reputation 
could be materially adversely affected and consequently, 
Holders of PERLS XII could lose all or part of their 
investment.
If you have any questions about these risks, you should 
seek advice from your financial or other professional 
adviser before deciding to invest in PERLS XII.
4.2 
 Risks associated with 
CommBank PERLS XII 
Capital Notes specifically 
4.2.1  Investments in PERLS XII 
are not deposit liabilities or 
protected accounts under 
the Banking Act
Investments in PERLS XII are an investment in CBA and 
may be affected by the ongoing performance, financial 
position and solvency of CBA. They are not deposit 
liabilities or protected accounts under the Banking Act. 
Therefore, PERLS XII are not guaranteed or insured 
by any Australian government, government agency 
or compensation scheme of Australia or any other 
jurisdiction.
4.2.2  Holders of PERLS XII are 
subordinated and unsecured 
creditors
In a winding up of CBA, Holders claims will rank after the 
claims of holders of Senior Ranking Obligations, creditors 
preferred by law and secured creditors.
Holders claims will rank equally with claims of holders of 
Equal Ranking Securities. This means your PERLS XII rank 
equivalently to a preference share.
Holders claims will rank ahead of claims of holders of 
Junior Ranking Securities (being holders of Ordinary 
Shares).
If, after the claims of holders of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, creditors preferred by law and secured 
creditors are satisfied there are insufficient assets to pay 
all amounts owing on PERLS XII and any Equal Ranking 
Securities, there is a risk that you may lose some or all of 
the money you invested in PERLS XII.
For further information see Sections1.1.2 Ranking of 
PERLS XII in a winding up of CBA and 2.6 How will 
CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes rank in a winding 
up?.
In addition, on Exchange, Holders will become holders of 
Ordinary Shares and rank equally with other holders of 
Ordinary Shares.
4.2.3  Distributions may not 
bepaid
Payment of a Distribution is subject to:
 
CBA, in its absolute discretion, making the Distribution 
to Holders;
 
payment not resulting in a breach of CBAs capital 
requirements under APRAs prudential standards as 
they are applied to the CBA Level 1 Group or the CBA 
Level 2 Group;
 
payment not resulting in CBA becoming, or being 
likely to become, insolvent; and
 
APRA not otherwise objecting to the payment. 
No Distribution will be paid on Exchange where Exchange 
occurs due to a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event.
Distributions may not be paid if CBAs CET1 Capital Ratio 
falls into the CCB. For further information, see Section 
3.8.1 Capital adequacy.
Distributions that are not paid do not accrue and will not 
be subsequently paid. Non-payment of a Distribution on 
the relevant Distribution Payment Date will not be an 
event of default and CBA will have no liability to Holders 
in respect of the unpaid Distribution. However, from that 
Distribution Payment Date and until a Distribution is 
paid in full on a subsequent Distribution Payment Date 
(or all PERLS XII are Exchanged, Redeemed or otherwise 
terminated), CBA cannot (subject to certain exceptions):
 
declare or determine a dividend on Ordinary Shares; 
or
 
return any capital or undertake any buy-backs or 
repurchases in relation to Ordinary Shares. 
To prevent these restrictions from occurring, CBA must 
pay all Distributions when scheduled, or, if all or any 
part of a Distribution is not paid when scheduled, in 
full within 5 Business Days of the Distribution Payment 
Date. Therefore, CBA would expect to give priority to 
payments of Distributions and other similar Tier 1 Capital 
distributions to enable CBA to be able to continue paying 
Ordinary Share dividends.
Further, under the terms of some other securities issued 
by CBA, CBA may not be able to pay Distributions if it 
does not pay distributions on those other securities. If 
this occurs, the dividend and capital restrictions outlined 
above will apply.

4.2.4  PERLS XII may be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares on the 
Mandatory Exchange Date or if certain events occur
PERLS XII do not have a fixed maturity date but may be Exchanged into Ordinary Shares, Redeemed or Resold. The 
diagram below summarises when these events could occur. If none of these events occur, PERLS XII could remain on 
issue indefinitely and the Face Value will not be repaid.

(seeSection 2.4 Automatic Exchange on a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event and Section 2.5 
Automatic Exchange on a Change of Control Event). Maximum Exchange Number calculated based on 20% of 
Issue Date VWAP.

Exchange).
Maximum Exchange Number

Issue Date VWAP.
20 April 2029 
Mandatory Exchange Date 
(if not Redeemed on the Call 
Date or Exchanged earlier)
If Mandatory Exchange does not 
occur on the Mandatory Exchange 
Date, then Mandatory Exchange 
will occur on the first Distribution 
Date after that date on which the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions 
are satisfied (see Section 2.3 
Mandatory Exchange).
Maximum Exchange Number 
calculated based on 50% of Issue 
Date VWAP.
Each Distribution Payment Date 
after Mandatory Exchange Date
4.2.4.1  Holders may receive Ordinary Shares 
on the Mandatory Exchange Date
Unless Redeemed or Exchanged earlier, PERLS XII must 
be Exchanged on the Mandatory Exchange Date (subject 
to the Mandatory Exchange Conditions).
Normally, you will receive a variable number of Ordinary 
Shares with a value equal to A$101.01 (based on the 
Initial Face Value of A$100 and the VWAP of Ordinary 
Shares with the benefit of a 1% discount, see Section 2.3 
Mandatory Exchange). For example, if the VWAP of 
Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Exchange Date 
is A$75, you would receive 1.3468 Ordinary Shares per 
PERLS XII. If the Ordinary Share price on the Exchange 
Date remained A$75, this would have a market value of 
A$101.01.
However, CBA will only be required to Exchange PERLS 
XII if all the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied 
(see Section 2.3 Mandatory Exchange). For example, if 
the Issue Date VWAP is A$80, then: 
 
under the First Mandatory Exchange Condition, if the 
VWAP of Ordinary Shares on the 25th Business Day 
before the Mandatory Exchange Date is greater than 
A$44.80, the First Mandatory Exchange Condition 
would be satisfied; 
 
under the Second Mandatory Exchange Condition, 
if the VWAP of Ordinary Shares during the period 
of 20Business Days before the Mandatory 
Exchange Date is greater than A$40.41, then the 
Second Mandatory Exchange Condition would be 
satisfied;and
 
under the Third Mandatory Exchange Condition, if the 
Ordinary Shares are listed or admitted to trading on 
ASX as at the date of the Mandatory Exchange Date, 
then the Third Mandatory Exchange Condition would 
be satisfied. 
If any of these Mandatory Exchange Conditions are not 
satisfied, it means that the Ordinary Share price has 
fallen below these levels during the relevant periods 
and Exchange will not occur. If Exchange does not occur, 
you will continue to hold your PERLS XII until the first 
Distribution Payment Date after that date on which all the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied at which 
time Exchange will occur.
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less 
than A$101.01 in some circumstances, including:
 
if the Face Value has previously been reduced 
(following a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event); or
 
to realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you sell 
them on ASX at the prevailing market price. However, 
depending on the time you decide to sell and the 
market price at that time, it is possible that your sale 
proceeds may be less than the Face Value.

Section 4
4.2.4.2  Holders may receive Ordinary 
Sharesupon the occurrence of a 
CapitalTrigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event
Unless Redeemed or Exchanged earlier, PERLS XII must 
be Exchanged upon the occurrence of a Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event.
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply. 
Therefore, CBA will be required to Exchange PERLS XII 
in all circumstances, regardless of the level at which 
the Ordinary Share price is trading, and the Maximum 
Exchange Number may limit the number of Ordinary 
Shares you receive.
The value of Ordinary Shares you receive could be less 
than A$101.01 in some circumstances, including:
 
if the Face Value has previously been reduced 
(following a previous Capital Trigger Event or  
Non-Viability Trigger Event);
 
the maximum number of Ordinary Shares that you 
can receive is limited to a number calculated based on 
20% of the Issue Date VWAP. For example, if the Issue 
Date VWAP is A$80, then the Maximum Exchange 
Number would be 6.2500 Ordinary Shares per PERLS 
XII;and
 
to realise the value of the Ordinary Shares, you sell 
them on ASX at the prevailing market price. However, 
depending on the time you decide to sell and the 
market price at that time, it is possible that your sale 
proceeds may be less than the Face Value.
If you wish to sell your Ordinary Shares, there is also a risk 
that Ordinary Shares may no longer be listed on ASX at 
the time of Exchange upon the occurrence of a Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event and you may 
not be able to sell your Ordinary Shares at all.
4.2.4.3  Holders may receive Ordinary Shares 
upon the occurrence of a Change of 
Control Event
Unless Redeemed or Exchanged earlier, PERLS XII 
must be Exchanged upon the occurrence of a Change 
of Control Event (subject to the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions applying with the modifications in Clause 
4.7(c) of the Terms).
The consequences of Exchange in this situation are the 
same as for Mandatory Exchange (see Section 4.2.4.1 
Holders may receive Ordinary Shares on the Mandatory 
Exchange Date). 
4.2.4.4  Consequences of holding Ordinary 
Shares
Ordinary Shares are a different type of investment to 
PERLS XII. Dividends on Ordinary Shares are payable 
at the absolute discretion of CBA and the amount of 
each dividend is discretionary (not subject to a formula). 
In contrast, Distributions on PERLS XII are payable in 
accordance with the formulae in Clauses 2.2 and 2.3 
of the Terms and subject to the Distribution payment 
conditions in Clause 2.5 of the Terms. In a winding up of 
CBA, claims of holders of Ordinary Shares rank behind 
claims of holders of all other securities and debts of CBA. 
In contrast, claims of PERLS XII holders rank ahead of 
holders of Ordinary Shares.
Ordinary Shares are an equity security and may trade at 
a market price which is different to a hybrid security such 
as PERLS XII. The market price of Ordinary Shares may 
be more sensitive than that of PERLS XII to changes in 
CBAs performance, operational issues and other business 
issues.
4.2.5  A Capital Trigger Event or 
Non-Viability Trigger Event 
may occur
4.2.5.1  Definition of Capital Trigger Event and 
Non-Viability Trigger Event
A Capital Trigger Event occurs when CBA determines, or 
APRA notifies CBA in writing that it believes, that either 
or both the CBA Level 1 CET1 Capital Ratio or CBA Level 2 
CET1 Capital Ratio is equal to or less than 5.125%.
The CET1 Capital Ratio is the ratio of CBAs CET1 Capital 
to its RWA, where CET1 Capital is the strongest form of 
capital held by CBA.
If a Capital Trigger Event occurs, CBA must immediately 
Exchange such number of PERLS XII (or a percentage of 
the Face Value of each PERLS XII) to return either or both 
the CBA Level 1 CET1 Capital Ratio or CBA Level 2 CET1 
Capital Ratio, as the case may be, to above 5.125%.
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies 
CBA in writing that it believes:
 
Exchange of all or some PERLS XII (or the taking of 
any action in relation to other capital instruments of 
the CBA Group) is necessary because, without it, CBA 
would become non-viable; or
 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it CBA would 
become non-viable.
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, CBA must 
immediately Exchange such number of PERLS XII 
(or a percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII) as 
specified by APRA or necessary to satisfy APRA that CBA 
will no longer be non-viable. In the case of a public sector 
injection of capital, or equivalent support, all PERLS XII 
must be Exchanged.
4.2.5.2  Examples of situations in which a  
Non-Viability Trigger Event may occur
Whether a Non-Viability Trigger Event will occur is at the 
discretion of APRA and there are currently no precedents. 
The circumstances in which APRA may exercise its 
discretion are not limited to when APRA may have a 
concern about a banks capital levels but may also include 
a banks funding and liquidity levels.
In Section 4.3 Risks associated with CBAs businesses 
which may affect CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes, a 
number of general risks associated with CBAs businesses 
are outlined. If one, or a combination, of these risks leads to 
a significant capital loss, or prolonged difficulties in raising 
funding or maintaining sufficient liquidity, this may be the

type of situation in which APRA may become concerned 
and notify CBA that it has become non-viable. The risks 
outlined in Section 4.3 Risks associated with CBAs 
business which may affect CommBank PERLS XII Capital 
Notes are examples only and not exhaustive, andthere 
may be other risks which affect the performance of CBA.
4.2.5.3  Consequences of the occurrence of a 
Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event
The inclusion of the Capital Trigger Event and  
Non-Viability Trigger Event in the terms of capital 
securities has been a requirement under APRAs 
prudential standards since 1 January 2013.
In the past, if a bank experienced financial difficulty 
and needed to accept public or private assistance or 
investment, holders of capital securities would be subject 
to the arrangements negotiated on their behalf by the 
bank with the Government or private investors (as the 
case may be) at the time. The nature and terms of those 
arrangements were uncertain until that time arose.
The inclusion of the Capital Trigger Event and  
Non-Viability Trigger Event is intended to provide an 
advanced framework for the treatment of Holders if CBA 
experiences significant financial difficulty. Upon the 
occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, CBA must immediately Exchange all or 
some PERLS XII (or a percentage of the Face Value of 
each PERLS XII). 
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not apply and 
the Terms provide that Exchange occurs automatically 
without the need for any further act or step by CBA and 
that CBA will recognise Holders as having been issued 
Ordinary Shares. 
Any ASX trades in PERLS XII that have not settled on the 
date a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
occurs will continue to settle in accordance with the normal 
ASX T+2 settlement, although the seller will be treated as 
having delivered, and the buyer will be treated as having 
acquired, the number of Ordinary Shares into which PERLS 
XII have been Exchanged as a result of the occurrence of 
the Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event.
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs because there has 
been a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, all PERLS XII must be Exchanged.
However, the number of Ordinary Shares you will receive 
is limited to the Maximum Exchange Number. For further 
information about the consequences of the application 
of the Maximum Exchange Number, see Section 
4.2.4.2 Holders may receive Ordinary Shares upon the 
occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event. 
If the Exchange fails to take effect for any reason and CBA 
has not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to 
be issued in respect of such Exchange within 5 Business 
Days, then Holders rights under the relevant PERLS XII 
will be immediately and irrevocably terminated and such 
termination will be taken to have occurred immediately 
on the date of the occurrence of the Capital Trigger 
Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event. Your investment 
in the relevant PERLS XII will lose all of its value  the 
Face Value will not be repaid and you will not receive any 
compensation. This could occur if CBA was prevented 
from issuing Ordinary Shares by circumstances outside its 
control, for example, if CBA was prevented by a specified 
law or order of any court, or action of any government 
authority, from issuing Ordinary Shares.
4.2.5.4  CBA proactively manages its capital, 
funding and liquidity positions to avoid 
experiencing financial difficulty
CBA conservatively and proactively manages its capital, 
funding and liquidity positions to avoid experiencing 
financial difficulty. 
For further information about CBAs capital, funding and 
liquidity positions, how they are managed and the CBA 
Level 2 CET1 Capital Ratio surplus above the level of 
5.125%, see Section 3.8.1 Capital adequacy and Section 
3.8.2 Funding and liquidity. However, there are a 
number of risks which are wholly or partly outside CBAs 
control as discussed in Section 4.3 below. 
4.2.6  PERLS XII may not be 
Exchanged on the Scheduled 
Mandatory Exchange Date
PERLS XII may not be Exchanged on the Scheduled 
Mandatory Exchange Date because the Mandatory 
Exchange Conditions are not satisfied. This could 
occur, for example, because the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions are not satisfied due to a large fall in the 
Ordinary Share price relative to the Issue Date VWAP, or if 
the Ordinary Shares are Delisted. 
The market price of Ordinary Shares is relevant to 
determining whether Exchange will occur, and also the 
number of Ordinary Shares a Holder will receive on 
Exchange. The market price of Ordinary Shares may be 
impacted by transactions affecting the share capital of 
CBA, such as rights issues, placements, returns of capital, 
buy-backs, demergers, and other corporate actions. 
However, the Issue Date VWAP is adjusted only for pro-
rata bonus issues of Ordinary Shares and certain types 
of capital reconstructions as described in Clauses 7.5 and 
7.6 of the Terms and not for other types of corporate 
transactions such as those mentioned above. The Terms 
do not limit the transactions which CBA is permitted to 
undertake with respect to its share capital. 
If Exchange does not occur, then (unless Exchange occurs 
in the meantime pursuant to a Capital Trigger Event and 
Non-Viability Trigger Event  see Section 4.2.5 A Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event may occur) 
you will continue to hold your PERLS XII until the first 
Distribution Payment Date after that date on which all 
the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied. PERLS 
XII are a perpetual security and it is possible that the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions may never be satisfied 
and that PERLS XII may never be Exchanged.
To realise your investment, you can sell your PERLS XII on 
ASX at the prevailing market price. However, depending 
on market conditions at the time, PERLS XII may be 
trading at a market price below the Face Value and/or the 
market for PERLS XII may not be liquid.

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes (continued)
Section 4
4.2.7  CBA may Redeem, or procure 
a Resale of, PERLS XII in 
certain circumstances 
CBA has the right to Redeem PERLS XII or choose that 
Resale occur on the Call Date, or Redeem PERLS XII at 
any time for tax or regulatory reasons or if it is unable to 
frank Distributions. CBAs right to Redeem PERLS XII is 
subject to prior written approval from APRA. Approval is 
at the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given.
The timing or occurrence of the Redemption or Resale 
may not coincide with your individual preferences.
In addition, if PERLS XII are Redeemed for tax or 
regulatory reasons or because CBA is unable to frank 
Distributions then, depending on market conditions at 
the time, you may not be able to reinvest the amount you 
receive on Redemption at a similar rate of return to the 
rate of return you expected on your PERLS XII if you had 
continued to hold them. 
4.2.8  Holders do not have a 
right to request that their 
PERLS XII be Exchanged or 
Redeemed early
Holders do not have a right to request that their PERLS 
XII be Exchanged or Redeemed early for any reason.
To realise your investment, you can sell your PERLS XII on 
ASX at the prevailing market price. However, depending on 
market conditions at the time, PERLS XII may be trading at 
a market price below the Face Value and/or the market for 
PERLS XII may not be liquid. For further information about 
liquidity risks associated with PERLS XII, see Section 4.2.12 
The liquidity of PERLS XII may below. 
4.2.9  CBA may raise more debt 
and issue other securities
CBA has the right in its absolute discretion to issue 
additional Senior Ranking Obligations, Equal Ranking 
Securities or Junior Ranking Securities which may: 
 
rank for dividends or payments of capital (including 
on the winding-up of CBA) equal with, behind or 
ahead of PERLS XII; 
 
have the same or different dividend, interest or 
distribution rates as PERLS XII;
 
have payment tests and distribution restrictions 
or other covenants which may affect PERLS XII 
(including by restricting circumstances in which 
Distributions can be paid on PERLS XII or PERLS XII 
can be Redeemed); or
 
have the same or different terms and conditions as 
PERLS XII.
The Terms do not contain any covenants preventing 
CBA from raising more debt or issuing other securities, 
requiring CBA to refrain from certain business changes, or 
requiring CBA to operate within certain ratio limits.
A Holding of PERLS XII does not confer any right to 
participate in further issues of securities by CBA.
It is difficult to anticipate the effect such debt or other 
issues of securities may have on the market price or 
liquidity of PERLS XII.
4.2.10  The Distribution Rate will 
fluctuate
The Distribution Rate is a floating rate, based on the 
Market Rate (which is a floating rate) plus the Margin 
(which is fixed). The Market Rate will fluctuate and 
therefore the Distribution Rate will fluctuate. Over the 
term of PERLS XII, the Distribution Rate may be higher or 
lower than the initial Distribution Rate on the Issue Date. 
It is possible for the Market Rate to become negative. 
Should this occur, the negative amount will be taken into 
account in calculating the Distribution Rate.
If the Distribution Rate decreases, there is a risk that 
the return on PERLS XII may become less attractive 
compared to returns on comparable securities or 
investments.
CBA does not guarantee any particular rate of return on 
PERLS XII.
4.2.11  The market price of 
PERLSXII will fluctuate
CBA has applied for quotation of PERLS XII on ASX. The 
market price of PERLS XII on ASX will fluctuate due to 
various factors, including:
 
changes in Australian and international economic 
conditions, interest rates, credit margins, inflation 
rates and foreign exchange rates;
 
if CBAs financial performance or position declines, or 
if market participants anticipate that it may decline, an 
investment in PERLS XII could decline in value even if 
PERLS XII have not been Exchanged;
 
changes to CBAs credit rating. For further information 
about the impacts of credit ratings on CBA, see 
Section 4.3.14 CBAs results may be adversely affected 
by liquidity and funding risks;
 
movements in the market price of equity and/or other 
debt issued by CBA or by other issuers;
 
changes in investor perceptions and sentiment in 
relation to CBA or the financial services industry; and
 
other major Australian and international events, such 
as hostilities and tensions, and acts of terrorism.
PERLS XII may trade at a market price below the Face 
Value during this time and the market price may be more 
sensitive than that of equity to changes in interest rates, 
credit margins and other market prices.
If PERLS XII trade at a market price below the amount at 
which you acquired them, there is a risk that, if you sell 
them, you may lose some of the money you invested.
CBA does not guarantee the market price of PERLS XII.
4.2.12  The liquidity of PERLS XII 
may be low
The market on ASX for PERLS XII may not be liquid and 
may be less liquid than that of Ordinary Shares.
If liquidity is low, there is a risk that, if you wish to sell 
your PERLS XII, you may not be able to do so at a price 
acceptable to you or at all.

4.2.13  Holders may be subject to 
FATCA withholding and 
information reporting
The objective of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance 
Act (FATCA) is to target tax non-compliance by US 
taxpayers with foreign financial assets, and requires 
reporting of such financial assets by third parties.
In order to comply with FATCA, it is possible that CBA (or, 
if PERLS XII are held through another financial institution, 
that other financial institution) may be required 
(pursuant to an agreement with the IRS or otherwise 
under applicable law) to request certain information 
from Holders or beneficial owners of PERLS XII, which 
information may in turn be provided to the IRS or other 
relevant tax authority. 
If CBA or any other person is required to withhold 
amounts as a result of Holders and beneficial owners 
of PERLS XII not providing the required information or 
documentation, then those Holders and beneficial owners 
will not be entitled to receive any gross up or additional 
amounts to compensate them for such withholding. 
This information is based on guidance issued by the 
IRS or other relevant tax authority as at the date of this 
Prospectus. Future guidance may affect the application of 
FATCA to CBA, Holders or beneficial owners of PERLS XII.
In addition, the OECD Common Reporting Standard for 
the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information 
(CRS) requires certain financial institutions to report 
financial information regarding certain accounts to their 
local tax authority. The CRS applies to Australian financial 
institutions from 1 July 2017. Holders may be requested 
to provide certain information to ensure compliance 
with CRS. This information may be provided to the 
Australian Taxation Office which, in turn, may provide this 
information to other countries that have signed the CRS 
Competent Authority Agreement.
4.2.14 CBA may amend the Terms
CBA may amend the Terms in two ways:
 
without the consent of Holders and subject to 
compliance with relevant laws  as set out in the 
Terms, including if the amendment is of a formal, 
technical or minor nature; to correct an error; to 
facilitate the listing; to comply with relevant laws; to 
amend any date or time period in connection with 
any Exchange, Resale or Redemption; where there is 
no material prejudice; or to enable the substitution of 
a NOHC as the debtor of PERLS XII provided certain 
substitution conditions are satisfied; and
 
with the consent of Holders  if a Special Resolution is 
passed.
In both cases, the Terms of all PERLS XII will be amended. 
In particular in the latter case, Holders who did not vote 
with the majority will be subject to the amended Terms 
which may not coincide with their individual preferences.
CBA may also amend the Terms in circumstances where 
the Market Rate ceases to be available (i.e. a Market Rate 
Disruption Event occurs) and replace the Market Rate 
with an alternative rate that CBA considers appropriate 
(in some cases subject to APRAs prior written approval), 
acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable 
manner, and make certain other consequential 
amendments to the Terms. Such amendments could 
adversely affect the interests of PERLS XII Holders.
Certain amendments require prior written approval from 
APRA. Approval is at the discretion of APRA and may or 
may not be given.
4.2.15  CBA may substitute for itself 
a non-operating holding 
company (NOHC)
CBA may substitute for itself a NOHC as the debtor in 
respect of PERLS XII or as the issuer of ordinary shares on 
Exchange. If a NOHC is substituted as the debtor it means 
that you would no longer have rights against CBA. If a 
NOHC is substituted as the issuer of ordinary shares on 
Exchange it means that you will receive ordinary shares in 
the NOHC rather than CBA.
Although not currently contemplated, the 
implementation of a NOHC structure may involve 
CBA selling some but not all of its business, and other 
subsidiaries, to the NOHC or a subsidiary of the NOHC. As 
a result, the profits and net asset position of CBA and the 
NOHC may be different to that of CBA prior to the NOHC 
structure being implemented.
4.2.16  Powers of an ADI Statutory 
Manager and of APRA
In certain circumstances, APRA may appoint a statutory 
manager to take control of the business of an Australian 
ADI, including CBA. The statutory manager has specific 
powers to take certain actions which may affect the 
ongoing operation of CBA and therefore its financial 
position which is relevant to PERLS XII.
4.3  
 Risks associated with CBAs 
businesses which may 
affect CommBank PERLS XII 
Capital Notes 
4.3.1  CBA is subject to extensive 
regulation and operates 
in an environment of 
political scrutiny, which 
could adversely impact its 
operations and financial 
condition
CBA and its businesses are subject to extensive regulation 
in Australia and across multiple regulatory bodies as well 
as other regulators in jurisdictions in which CBA operates 
or obtains funding, including New Zealand, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, China, Japan, Europe, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia.
Key domestic regulators include APRA, ASIC, AUSTRAC, 
the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, 
the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, 
the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, the RBA 
and the ASX.

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes (continued)
Section 4
APRA, as CBAs prudential regulator in Australia has very 
wide powers under the Banking Act, including in limited 
circumstances to direct banks (including CBA) not to 
make payments on their securities.
In addition to its key Australian regulators, a range 
of international regulators and authorities supervise 
and regulate CBA in respect of, among other areas, 
capital adequacy, liquidity levels, funding, provisioning, 
insurances, compliance with prudential regulation and 
standards, accounting standards, remuneration, data 
access, stock exchange listing requirements, and its 
compliance with relevant financial crime, sanction, 
privacy, taxation, competition, consumer protection and 
securities trading laws.
CBA and the wider financial services industry are 
facing increased regulation in many of these areas and 
jurisdictions and changes or new regulation in one part of 
the world could lead to changes elsewhere.
Any change in law, regulation, accounting standards, 
policy or practice of regulators, or failure to comply 
with laws, regulation or policy, may adversely affect 
CBAs business, financial condition, liquidity, operations, 
prospects and its reputation, and its ability to execute 
its strategy, either on a short-term or long-term basis. 
The potential impacts of regulatory change are wide, 
and could include increasing the levels and types of 
capital CBA is required to hold and restricting the way 
CBA can conduct its business and the nature of that 
business, such as the types of products that it can offer 
to customers.
CBA may also be adversely affected if the pace or extent 
of such regulatory change exceeds CBAs ability to adapt 
to such changes and embed appropriate compliance 
processes adequately. The pace of regulatory change 
means that the regulatory context in which CBA operates 
is often uncertain and complex.
4.3.1.1 Regulatory reforms
Examples of significant regulatory reform under 
development in Australia include a review of Open 
Banking (as defined below), APRAs proposals to revise 
the capital framework for ADIs and the Treasury Laws 
Amendment (Design and Distribution Obligations and 
Product Intervention Powers) Act 2019.
 
In late 2017, the Australian Government announced 
it would legislate an economy-wide Consumer Data 
Right (CDR) to give consumers access to and control 
over their data, beginning with banking (referred to 
as Open Banking). The Australian Government has 
decided to phase in Open Banking with the major 
banks to make product data available for credit and 
debit card, deposit and transaction accounts from July 
2019, before expanding to other banking products 
(e.g. mortgages) and sharing of consumer data 
between major banks and accredited third parties 
(at the direction of the consumer) for credit and 
debit card, deposit and transaction accounts from 
February 2020. These reforms are intended to increase 
competition in the financial sector and improve 
customer outcomes. CDR laws have now been passed 
by the Federal Parliament in Australia, with the 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 
CDR Rules to be passed and Data Standards to be 
finalised. Increased competition resulting from Open 
Banking may adversely impact CBAs business and 
financial condition.
 
The finalisation of the capital reforms, which are 
currently under consultation with APRA, may result in 
changes to the risk-weighting framework for certain 
asset classes, which are expected to increase CBAs 
RWA and accordingly (all things being equal) reduce 
CBAs CET1 Capital Ratio. As part of the revisions to 
the capital framework, APRA is also consulting with 
the industry on approaches for achieving international 
comparability, without changing the quantum amount 
of CET1 Capital ADIs are required to hold. In addition, 
on 9 July 2019, APRA announced its decision on the 
LAC to support the orderly resolution of Australian 
ADIs, which increased the total capital requirement 
for domestically systemically important banks, such as 
CBA, by 3%. APRA has stated that, over the next four 
years, it may consider feasible alternatives to further 
increase the LAC by an additional 1-2%. The form of 
such alternatives remains uncertain, and APRA has 
indicated that it expects to consult with the industry 
and other stakeholders.
 
The finalisation of these proposals may have the 
following impacts: 
 
implications for the CCB which may affect the 
payment of Distributions (see Section 3.8.1.3 
Potential impact of falling into the capital 
conservation buffer for more information on the 
CCB);
 
further changes to the risk-weighting framework 
for certain asset classes, which are expected to 
increase CBAs RWA and accordingly (all things 
being equal) reduce CBAs CET1 Capital Ratio 
which may affect the risk of a Capital Trigger Event 
occurring (see Section 2.4 Automatic Exchange on 
a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-Viability Trigger 
Event and Section 4.2.5 A Capital Trigger Event or 
Non-Viability Trigger Event may occur); and/or
 
adjustments to an ADIs existing minimum 
CET1 Capital Ratios may increase the PCR 
and CCB components, which may result in 
APRA determining that a Capital Trigger Event 
percentage higher than 5.125% is appropriate. At 
this stage, the potential impact on PERLS XII and 
other Equal Ranking Securities remains uncertain. 
Potential scenarios for PERLS XII include:
 
CBA may have an early redemption right 
(subject to APRAs approval) under Clause 5.4 
of the Terms;
 
CBA may amend the Terms without 
the consent of Holders to adjust to a 
higher CapitalTrigger Event percentage 
(Clause 12.3(d)(ii)); or
 
APRA may grandfather PERLS XII and other 
Equal Ranking Securities currently on issue, i.e. 
capital adequacy (as detailed in Section 3.8.1 
Capital adequacy), may be assessed under 
the existing or revised APRA Prudential 
Standards.

PERLS XII Prospectus
 
The Treasury Laws Amendment (Design and 
Distribution Obligations and Product Intervention 
Powers) Act 2019 (Cth) came into force on 5 April 
2019 and introduced both design and distribution 
obligations on certain issuers and distributors of 
financial products (including hybrid securities) to retail 
investors and new product intervention powers for 
ASIC. The product design and distribution obligations 
have a two year transitional period and therefore do 
not come into force until April 2021. Relevantly, the 
product design and distribution obligations require 
issuers to prepare and make publicly available a 
target market determination (TMD), which aims 
to ensure that financial products for the retail market 
are targeted and sold to appropriate investors. Issuers 
must then take reasonable steps to ensure compliance 
with the TMD by distributors and are subject to 
ongoing obligations to review the TMD. Distributors 
must not distribute a product to retail investors unless 
it has a TMD and must also take reasonable steps to 
ensure their distribution is consistent with the TMD. 
ASIC is expected to provide regulatory guidance in 
respect of the design and distribution obligations by 
the end of 2019. The impact of these new obligations 
remains untested, however there is a risk that they 
may adversely impact the issue, distribution and 
reinvestment of financial products in the future, 
including instruments like PERLS XII. These changes 
may also affect the liquidity of funding instruments 
(including hybrids such as PERLS XII), if they lead to 
a material reduction in future issuance volumes or 
secondary trading activity by investors.
Outside Australia there have also been a series of other 
regulatory initiatives from authorities in the various 
jurisdictions in which CBA operates or obtains funding 
that would result in significant regulatory changes for 
financial institutions.
As an example, and as outlined in Section 3.8.1.5 
Regulatory developments, the Reserve Bank of New 
Zealand is undertaking a comprehensive review of the 
capital adequacy framework applying to registered banks 
in New Zealand. Among the proposals being considered 
is an increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement 
for banks which are deemed systemically important to 
16% of RWA (currently 8.5%). It is possible that such 
proposals, if implemented, could impact CBAs capital 
minimums and targets.
4.3.1.2  Other regulatory and political 
developments
There is currently an environment of heightened scrutiny 
by the Australian Government and various Australian 
regulators on the Australian financial services industry. 
An example of industry-wide scrutiny that may lead 
to future changes in laws, regulation or policies, is the 
establishment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the 
misconduct by financial service entities. 
The Royal Commission was established on  
14 December 2017 and was authorised to inquire 
into misconduct by financial service entities 
(including the CBA Group). Seven rounds of hearings 
into misconduct in the banking and financial services 
industry were held throughout 2018, covering a variety 
of topics including consumer and business lending, 
financial advice, superannuation, insurance and a policy 
round. The Royal Commissions final report was delivered 
on 1 February 2019. The final report included 76 policy 
recommendations to the Australian Government and 
findings in relation to the case studies investigated during 
the hearings, with a number of referrals being made to 
regulators for misconduct by financial institutions, which 
has resulted in heightened levels of enforcement action 
across the industry including key regulators investigating 
all matters raised by the Royal Commission. 
The 76 recommendations covered many of CBAs business 
areas, and also canvassed the role of the regulators and 
the approach to be taken to customer focus, culture 
and remuneration. The recommendations regarding the 
role of regulators, in particular ASICs why not litigate 
approach for breaches of financial services law, will likely 
lead to a change in CBAs regulator relationships and CBA 
is seeing an increase in investigation and litigation activity, 
which could potentially have a cumulative impact on costs 
and reputation. CBA released a statement to the ASX on 
8 March 2019 welcoming the final report and committing 
to actions to deliver on the recommendations.
4.3.2   CBA may be adversely 
affected by damage to its 
reputation
The CBA Groups reputation is a valuable asset and a 
key contributor to the support that it receives from the 
community for its business initiatives and its ability to 
raise funding or capital. Damage to CBAs reputation may 
arise where there are differences between stakeholder 
expectations and CBAs actual or perceived practices. The 
risk of reputational damage may also be a secondary 
outcome of other sources of risk. 
Various issues, including a number of the risks described 
in this Section 4.3, may give rise to reputational damage 
and cause harm to CBAs business, financial condition, 
operations and prospects. These issues include the CBA 
Groups conduct (for example, inadequate sales and 
trading practices, inappropriate management of conflicts 
of interest and other ethical issues), breaches of legal 
and regulatory requirements (such as money laundering, 
counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions privacy and 
anti-hawking laws), technology and information security 
failures, unsuccessful strategies or strategies that are not 
in line with community expectations and non-compliance 
with internal policies and procedures. CBAs reputation 
may also be adversely affected by community perception 
of the broader financial services industry, or from the 
actions of its competitors, customers, suppliers, or 
companies in which CBA holds strategic investments. 
Failure, or perceived failure, to address these issues 
appropriately could also give rise to additional legal or 
regulatory risk, subjecting CBA to regulatory enforcement 
actions, fines and penalties, or further damage its 
reputation and integrity among its stakeholders including 
customers, investors and the community.

Section 4
4.3.3   CBA may be adversely 
impacted by a downturn 
in the Australian or New 
Zealand economies
As CBAs businesses are primarily located in Australia 
and New Zealand, CBAs performance is dependent on 
the state of these economies, customer and investor 
confidence, and prevailing market conditions in these two 
countries.
CBA can give no assurances as to the likely future 
conditions of the Australian and New Zealand economies, 
which can be influenced by many factors within and 
outside these countries, which are outside CBAs control, 
including domestic and international economic events, 
political events, natural disasters and any other event that 
impacts global financial markets.
China is one of Australias major trading partners and a 
significant driver of commodity demand and prices in 
many of the markets in which CBA and its customers 
operate. Anything that adversely affects Chinas economic 
growth, including the implementation of tariffs or other 
protectionist trade policy, could adversely affect Australian 
economic activity and, as a result, CBAs business, 
financial condition, operations and prospects. 
The strength of the Australian economy is influenced 
by the strength of the Australian dollar. Significant 
movements in the Australian dollar may adversely impact 
parts of the Australian economy and, in turn, CBAs results 
of operations as described in Section 4.3.16. 
A material downturn in the Australian or New Zealand 
economies could adversely impact future results by 
reducing customers demand for CBAs products and 
borrowers ability to repay their loans to CBA (i.e. credit 
risk). In particular, given CBAs concentration of earnings 
from home loans, a significant or sustained decrease 
in the Australian and New Zealand housing markets 
or property valuations, including external factors or 
tightening lending standards could adversely affect 
CBAs home and commercial mortgage portfolio, result 
in a decrease in the amount of new lending CBA is able 
to undertake and/or increase the losses that CBA may 
experience from existing loans. These factors could 
adversely affect CBAs business, financial condition, 
operations and prospects.
4.3.4  CBA may be adversely 
affected by deteriorations in 
the global financial markets 
By the nature of its operations in various financial 
markets, CBA has previously been adversely impacted, 
both directly and indirectly, by difficult business, 
economic and market conditions and could be adversely 
affected should markets deteriorate again in the future. 
The financial system (or systems) within which CBA 
operates may experience systemic shock due to market 
volatility, political or economic instability or catastrophic 
events. 
A shock to or deterioration in the global economy could 
result in currency and interest rate fluctuations and 
operational disruptions that negatively impact the CBA 
Group. For example, global economic conditions may 
deteriorate to the extent that counterparties default on 
their debt obligations; countries re-denominate their 
currencies and/or introduce capital controls; one or 
more major economies collapse; and/or global financial 
markets cease to operate, or cease to operate efficiently. 
Sovereign defaults may adversely impact CBA directly, 
through adversely impacting the value of CBA assets, or 
indirectly through destabilising global financial markets, 
adversely impacting CBAs liquidity, financial performance 
or ability to access capital.
4.3.5  CBA is subject to intense 
competition which may 
adversely affect its results
CBA faces intense competition in all of its principal 
areas of operation. Competition is expected to increase, 
especially from non-Australian financial services providers 
who continue to expand in Australia, and from new 
non-bank entrants or smaller providers who may be 
unregulated or subject to lower or different prudential 
and regulatory standards than CBA and are therefore able 
to operate more efficiently. These entrants may seek to 
disrupt the financial services industry by offering bundled 
propositions and utilising new technologies. 
If CBA is unable to compete effectively in its various 
businesses and markets, its market share may decline and 
increased competition may also adversely affect CBAs 
results by diverting business to competitors or creating 
pressure to lower margins to maintain market share.
4.3.6  CBA may incur losses from 
operational risks associated 
with being a large financial 
institution
Operational risk is defined as the risk of economic gain 
or loss resulting from: (i) inadequate or failed internal 
processes and methodologies; (ii) people; (iii) systems 
and models used in making business decisions; or (iv) 
external events.
CBAs use of third party suppliers and third party 
partnerships, especially those where they supply CBA 
with critical services such as key technology systems or 
support, also expose it to operational risks, including the 
potential for a severe event at a third party impacting CBA.
CBAs businesses are highly dependent on their 
ability to process and monitor a very large number of 
transactions, many of which are highly complex, across 
multiple markets and in many currencies. CBAs financial, 
accounting, record-keeping, data processing or other 
operating systems, processes and facilities may fail to 
function properly or may become disabled as a result 
of events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, 
such as a spike in transaction volumes, damage to critical 
utilities, environmental hazard, natural disaster, or a 
failure of vendors systems. CBA could suffer losses due 
to impairment of assets, including software, goodwill and 
other intangible assets.
For personal use only
59
PERLS XII Prospectus
There is also a risk that poor decisions may be made due 
to data quality issues, models that are not fit for purpose, 
or inappropriate data management. This may cause CBA 
to incur losses, or result in regulatory action.
Management must exercise judgment in selecting and 
applying CBAs accounting policies so that not only 
do they comply with generally accepted accounting 
principles but they also reflect the most appropriate 
manner in which to record and report on the financial 
position and results of operations of CBA. Application of 
and changes to accounting policies may adversely impact 
CBAs results.
CBA may also be adversely impacted by failures in 
the efficacy, adequacy or implementation of its risk-
management strategies, frameworks and processes. The 
emergence of unexpected risks or unanticipated impacts 
of identified risks may result in financial or reputational 
losses for CBA.
4.3.7   CBA may be adversely 
impacted by information 
security risks, including 
cyber-attacks
CBAs businesses are highly dependent on its information 
technology systems, including those supplied by external 
service providers, to securely process, store, keep 
private and transmit information. These information 
technology systems are subject to information security 
risks. Information security risks for CBA have increased 
in recent years, in part because of: (i) the pervasiveness 
of technology to conduct financial transactions; (ii) the 
evolution and development of new technologies; (iii) 
CBAs increasing usage of digital channels; (iv) customers 
increasing use of personal devices that are beyond CBAs 
control systems; and (v) the increased sophistication and 
broadened activities of cyber criminals.
Although CBA takes protective measures and endeavours 
to modify these protective measures as circumstances 
warrant, its computer systems, software and networks 
may be vulnerable to unauthorised access, misuse, denial-
of-service attacks, phishing attacks, computer viruses or 
other malicious code and other events. These threats 
could result in the unauthorised release, gathering, 
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, 
proprietary and other information of CBA, its employees, 
customers or third parties or otherwise adversely impact 
network access or business operations.
An information security failure (including the impact of 
any cyber-attack), or more general mishandling of data, 
could have serious consequences for CBA, including 
operational disruption, financial losses, a loss of customer 
or business opportunities, litigation, regulatory penalties 
or intervention, reputational damage, theft of intellectual 
property, loss or theft of customer data, and could result in 
violations of applicable privacy laws.
4.3.8  CBA may be adversely 
affected by human capital 
risk
CBAs ability to attract and retain qualified and skilled 
executives, employees and Board members is an 
important factor in achieving the strategic objectives 
of the CBA Group. The Chief Executive Officer, the 
management team of the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Board have skills that are critical to setting the strategic 
direction, successful management and growth of CBA, 
and whose loss due to resignation, retirement, death or 
illness may adversely affect CBAs business, operations 
and financial condition. 
If CBA has difficulty retaining or attracting highly qualified 
people for important roles, including key executives and 
Board members, particularly in times of strategic change, 
CBAs business, operations and financial condition could 
be adversely affected.
4.3.9  CBA could suffer losses due 
to climate change
Climate change is systemic in nature, and is a significant 
long-term driver of both financial and non-financial 
risks. A failure to respond to the potential and expected 
impacts of climate change will affect CBAs long-term 
performance and can be expected to have group-wide 
impacts for the CBA Group in its lending (retail and 
business), procurement and investment portfolios. These 
include, but are not limited to, impacts on the probability 
of default and losses arising from defaults, valuations and 
collateral as well as portfolio performance.
CBA recognises that inadequate assessment and 
management of the physical risk (arising from extreme 
weather events and longer-term shifts in climate patterns) 
and transition risk (arising from legal, market, regulatory, 
technology and reputational changes associated with a 
transition to a low carbon economy) of climate change, 
have the potential to disrupt business activities, damage 
property and otherwise affect the value of assets, and 
affect our customers ability to repay loans. 
Climate change therefore has the potential to impact the 
CBA Groups franchise value, strategic risk and financial 
risk and poses a risk to CBAs cost of capital.
4.3.10  CBA is subject to compliance 
risks, which could adversely 
impact its future results and 
reputation
Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, 
material financial loss, or loss of reputation that CBA may 
suffer as a result of its failure to comply, or perceived 
failure to comply, with the requirements of relevant laws, 
regulatory bodies, industry standards and codes. Increasing 
volume, complexity and global reach of such requirements, 
and the increased propensity for sanctions and the level 
of financial penalties for breaches of requirements, could 
adversely impact on CBAs results and reputation.

Section 4
This includes for example, financial crime related 
obligations such as anti-money laundering and counter-
terrorism financing laws, anti-bribery and corruption laws 
and economic and trade sanctions laws in the jurisdictions 
in which it operates. The number and wide reach of these 
obligations, combined with the increasing global focus on 
compliance with and enforcement of these obligations, 
presents a risk of adverse impacts on CBA, including to its 
reputation.
Compliance risk may also arise where CBA interprets its 
obligations differently from regulators or a court.
4.3.11  CBAs business could be 
negatively impacted by 
substantial legal liability or 
regulatory action 
Due to the nature of CBAs business, it is involved 
in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, 
principally in Australia and New Zealand. Such matters 
are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of 
individual matters cannot be predicted with certainty. If 
CBA is ordered to pay money (for example, damages, 
fines, penalties or legal costs), has orders made against its 
assets (for example, a charging order or writ of execution), 
is ordered to carry out actions which adversely affect its 
business operations or reputation (for example, corrective 
advertising) or is otherwise subject to adverse outcomes 
of litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, CBAs 
business, financial condition, operations, prospects and 
reputation may be adversely affected. 
Examples of litigation and regulatory investigations 
include the shareholder class actions and an ASIC 
investigation both of which relate to the subject matter of 
the proceedings that were commenced against CBA by 
AUSTRAC (which have now been resolved), the class action 
proceedings concerning investment in cash and deposit 
options against Colonial First State Investments and CBA 
and the proceedings brought by the Commonwealth 
Director of Public Prosecutions against CommInsure Life 
for alleged contraventions of the anti-hawking provisions of 
the Corporations Act, as announced by CBA on 4 October 
2019. 
4.3.12  CBA may incur losses as a 
result of the inappropriate 
conduct of its staff
CBA could be adversely affected if an employee, 
contractor or external service provider does not act 
in accordance with regulations or CBAs policies and 
procedures, engages in inappropriate or fraudulent 
conduct, or unintentionally fails to meet a professional 
obligation to specific clients. Examples are inadequate 
or defective financial advice, product defects and 
unsuitability, market manipulation, insider trading, privacy 
or data security breaches and misleading or deceptive 
conduct in advertising. As a result, CBA could incur losses, 
financial penalties and reputational damage, and could be 
subject to legal or regulatory action. 
4.3.13  CBA may incur losses 
associated with 
counterparty exposures
CBA assumes counterparty risk in connection with 
its lending, trading, derivatives, insurance and other 
businesses as it relies on the ability of its counterparties 
to satisfy their financial obligations to the Issuer on a 
timely basis. For example, customers may default on their 
home, personal and business loans, and trades may fail to 
settle due to non-payment by a counterparty or a systems 
failure by clearing agents, exchanges, or other financial 
intermediaries. This risk also arises from CBAs exposure to 
lenders mortgage insurance and re-insurance providers. 
There is also a risk that CBAs rights against counterparties 
may not be enforceable in certain circumstances.
Counterparties may default on their obligations due to 
insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other 
reasons. This risk may be increased by a deterioration 
in economic conditions and a sustained high level 
of unemployment. In assessing whether to extend 
credit or enter into other transactions, CBA relies on 
counterparties providing information that is accurate and 
not misleading, including financial statements and other 
financial information. CBAs financial performance could 
be negatively impacted to the extent that it relies on 
information that is inaccurate or materially misleading.
Unexpected credit losses could have a significant adverse 
effect on CBAs business, financial condition, operations 
and prospects.
4.3.14  CBAs results may be 
adversely affected by 
liquidity and funding risks
CBA is subject to liquidity and funding risks, which could 
adversely impact its future results. Liquidity risk is the risk 
of being unable to meet financial obligations as and when 
they fall due. Funding risk is the risk of over-reliance on a 
funding source to the extent that a change or increased 
competition in that funding source could increase overall 
funding costs or cause difficulty in raising funds. 
Further information on liquidity and funding risk 
is outlined in the following sub-sections and is 
also included in the 2019 Annual Report. The 2019 
AnnualReport is available from the Investor Centre 
at www.commbank.com.au/annual-reports. 
(i) Adverse financial and credit market conditions 
may significantly affect CBAs ability to access 
international debt markets, on which it relies for a 
substantial amount of its wholesale funding
While the majority of CBAs funding comes from 
deposits, it remains reliant on offshore wholesale 
funding markets to source a significant amount of its 
funding and grow its business. 
Global market volatility may adversely impact the cost 
and CBAs ability to access wholesale funding markets, 
and may also result in increased competition for, and 
therefore the cost of deposits in Australia. 
For personal use only
61
PERLS XII Prospectus
If CBA is unable to pass its increased funding costs 
on to its customers, CBAs financial performance will 
decline due to lower net interest margins. If CBA is 
forced to seek alternative sources of funding, the 
availability of such alternative funding and the terms 
on which it may be available will depend on a variety 
of factors, including prevailing financial and credit 
market conditions. Even if available, the cost of these 
alternatives may be more expensive or they may 
only be available on unfavourable terms, which may 
adversely impact CBAs cost of borrowing and CBAs 
on-going operations and funding. If CBA is unable to 
source appropriate and timely funding, it may also be 
forced to reduce its lending or consider selling assets.
(ii) CBA may not be able to maintain adequate levels 
of liquidity and funding, which would adversely 
affect CBAs business, financial condition, 
operations and prospects
CBAs liquidity and funding policies are designed to 
ensure that it will meet its debts and other obligations as 
and when they fall due. Although CBA actively monitors 
and manages its liquidity and funding positions, there 
are factors outside CBAs control which could adversely 
affect these positions, for example, if financial markets 
are closed for an extended period of time, or if a change 
in customer behaviour driven by low, zero or negative 
interest rates leads to an outflow of deposits.
In addition to APRAs LCR requirements (effective 
1 January 2015), CBA must comply with the 
NSFR requirements, which came into effect from 
1 January 2018. If CBA fails to maintain adequate levels 
of liquidity and funding, it would adversely affect CBAs 
business, financial condition, operations and prospects.
(iii) Failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely 
affect CBAs cost of funds, liquidity, access to debt 
and capital markets and competitive position
CBAs credit ratings (which are strongly influenced by 
Australias sovereign credit rating) affect the cost and 
availability of its funding from debt and other funding 
sources. Credit ratings could be used by potential 
customers, lenders and investors in deciding whether 
to transact with or invest in CBA. 
A downgrade to CBAs credit ratings, or Australias 
sovereign credit rating, could adversely affect 
CBAs cost of funds, liquidity, access to debt and 
capital markets, collateralisation requirements and 
competitive position. 
Some ratings agencies also assign ratings to 
regulatory capital securities (such as PERLS XII) 
for use by wholesale investors and may announce 
changes to their rating methodology and/or to the 
securities ratings, either during the Offer Period or 
after PERLS XII has been issued.
4.3.15  CBA may be adversely 
affected by capital adequacy 
risk
CBA must satisfy substantial capital requirements, subject 
to qualitative and quantitative review and assessment by 
its regulators. Regulatory capital requirements influence 
how CBA uses its capital, and can restrict its ability to pay 
dividends and Additional Tier 1 distributions, or to make 
stock repurchases. CBAs capital ratios may be affected 
by a number of factors, including earnings, asset growth, 
changes in the value of the Australian dollar against 
other currencies in which CBA conducts its business, 
and changes in business strategy (including acquisitions, 
divestments, investments and changes in capital intensive 
businesses).
CBA operates an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) to manage its capital levels and to 
maintain them above the minimum levels approved by 
the Board (which are currently set to exceed regulatory 
requirements). The ICAAP includes forecasting and stress 
testing of capital levels, which guide CBA in selecting any 
capital management initiatives it may undertake. 
Should the ICAAP forecasts or stress tests prove to be 
ineffective, CBA may not be holding sufficient capital 
and may need to raise capital to manage balance sheet 
growth and/or extreme stress.
4.3.16  CBA may be adversely 
affected by market risks, 
including interest rates and 
exchange rates
CBA is exposed to market risks, including the potential 
for losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
(including potential for negative interest rates), foreign 
exchange rates, commodity and equity prices, credit 
spreads and implied volatility levels for assets and 
liabilities where options are transacted. This exposure 
is split between traded market risks, primarily through 
providing services to customers on a global basis, and 
non-traded market risks, predominantly interest rate risk 
in the banking book.
Changes in market factors such as potential 
developments or future changes in the administration of 
financial benchmark interest rates could result in adverse 
consequences to the return on, value of and market 
for, securities and other instruments whose returns are 
linked to any such benchmark, including those securities 
or other instruments issued by the CBA Group. If the 
CBA Group was to suffer substantial losses due to any 
market volatility, it may adversely affect the CBA Groups 
financial performance or financial condition.
Additionally, a significant proportion of CBAs wholesale 
funding and some of its profits and investments are in 
currencies other than the Australian dollar, principally the 
U.S. dollar and the Euro. This exposes CBA to exchange 
rate risk on these activities, as its functional and financial 
reporting currency is the Australian dollar. These activities 
are hedged where appropriate, however there are also 
risks associated with hedging, for example, a hedge 
counterparty may default on its obligations to CBA.

Risks of CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes (continued)
Section 4
For a description of these specific risks, see note 9.3 to 
CBAs audited consolidated and non-consolidated annual 
financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 
2019. There can be no assurance that CBAs exchange rate 
hedging arrangements or hedging policy will be sufficient 
or effective. CBAs results of operations may be adversely 
affected if its hedges are not effective to mitigate 
exchange rate risks, if CBA is inappropriately hedged or if 
a hedge provider defaults on its obligations under CBAs 
hedging agreements.
4.3.17  CBAs results could be 
adversely impacted by 
strategic risks
Strategic risk is the risk of material value destruction or 
less than planned value creation, due to changes in CBAs 
external and internal operating environment. Examples of 
strategic risk include:
 
suboptimal allocation and balance of CBAs resources 
to execute on its strategic objectives;
 
ineffective delivery of CBAs strategy (for example due 
to operational complexity or the pace of execution 
being too fast for processes, people and systems to 
work as they need to, or too slow to keep pace with 
the changing environment); and
 
the inability of CBA to keep pace with intensified 
competition from traditional and non-traditional 
financial services players across key value pools.
While the Board regularly monitors and discusses 
CBAs operating environment, strategic objectives and 
implementation of major strategic initiatives, there can be 
no assurance that such objectives and initiatives will be 
successful or that they will not adversely impact CBA.
4.3.18  CBAs performance and 
financial position may 
be adversely affected by 
acquisitions or divestments 
of businesses 
CBA is currently undertaking a number of divestments 
and strategic reviews of certain businesses, as outlined 
in Section 3.2 Businesses of CBA. CBA may further 
continue to divest businesses or capabilities it considers 
non-core or wind down businesses or product areas.
There is a risk that the cost and pace of executing 
divestments, including as a result of external approvals, 
may cause CBA to experience disruptions in the 
divestment, transition or wind down process, including 
to existing businesses, which may cause customers to 
remove their business from CBA or have other adverse 
impacts to CBA. 
From time to time, CBA evaluates and undertakes 
acquisitions of other businesses. There is a risk that 
CBA may not achieve the expected synergies from the 
acquisition, and may experience disruptions to its existing 
businesses due to difficulties in integrating the systems 
and processes of the acquired business. These may 
cause CBA to lose customers and market share, and incur 
financial losses. 
Multiple divestments and/or acquisitions at the same 
time may exacerbate these risks.
4.3.19  CBA could be adversely 
impacted by investor 
activism
CBA has in the past, and may in the future, be challenged 
on its strategy by shareholders, including institutional 
shareholders, and special interest groups. Areas which 
have attracted investor activism in Australia include 
making socially responsible investment and avoiding 
financing or interacting with businesses that do not 
demonstrate responsible management of environmental 
and social issues. The prevalence of investor activism 
could impact managements decision-making and 
implementation of CBAs initiatives, which in turn could 
adversely affect its financial results.
4.3.20  CBA may be adversely 
impacted by insurance risk
Events that the CBA Group has provided insurance 
against may occur more frequently or with greater 
severity than anticipated, which could adversely impact 
CBA. In the life insurance business, this risk arises 
primarily through mortality (death) and morbidity (illness 
and injury) related claims being greater than expected. In 
the general insurance business, this risk is mainly driven 
by weather related incidents (such as storms, floods or 
bushfires) and other catastrophes.

5.4.1 Introduction
The following is a summary of the Australian tax 
consequences for certain Australian resident Holders and 
non-Australian resident Holders who subscribe for  
PERLS XII under the Offer.
This summary is not exhaustive and you should seek 
advice from your financial or other professional adviser 
before deciding to invest in PERLS XII. In particular, 
this summary does not consider the consequences for 
Holders who:
 
acquire	PERLS	XII	otherwise	than	under	the	Offer;	
 
hold PERLS XII in their business of share trading, 
dealing in securities or otherwise hold their PERLS XII 
on	revenue	account	or	as	trading	stock;
 
are subject to the taxation of financial arrangements 
provisions in Division 230 of the Tax Act in relation to 
their	Holding	of	PERLS	XII;	and/or
 
in relation to a non-Australian resident, hold their 
PERLS XII through a permanent establishment 
inAustralia.
This summary is not intended to be, nor should it be 
construed as being, investment, legal or tax advice to any 
particular Holder.
This summary is based on Australian tax laws 
and regulations, interpretations of such laws and 
regulations, and administrative practice as at the date 
ofthisProspectus.
5.4.2  Class ruling sought on 
PERLS XII
CBA has applied to the ATO for a public class ruling 
confirming certain Australian income tax consequences 
for Australian resident Holders. In accordance with usual 
practice, a class ruling will only be issued after the public 
announcement of a transaction and will not become 
operative until it is published in the Government Gazette.
When issued, copies of the class ruling will be available 
from www.ato.gov.au and from the Investor Centre at 
https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/investors/other-
securities.

PERLS XII Prospectus
It is expected that, when issued, the class ruling will:
 
only be binding on the Commissioner of Taxation 
if the Offer is carried out in the specific manner 
described	in	the	class	ruling;
 
only apply to Australian resident Holders that are 
within the class of entities specified in the class 
ruling, which is expected to be Australian resident 
Holders who acquire their PERLS XII through the Offer 
and hold them on capital account for tax purposes. 
Therefore, the class ruling will not apply to Australian 
resident Holders who hold their PERLS XII as trading 
stock	or	on	revenue	account;
 
only rule on taxation laws applicable as at the date the 
class	ruling	is	issued;
 
not consider the tax consequences of an early 
Exchange	or	Resale;
 
not consider the taxation treatment of Distributions 
received	by	partnerships	or	trustee	investors;	and
 
not consider the tax consequences for Australian 
resident Holders for whom gains and losses from 
PERLS XII are subject to the taxation of financial 
arrangements provisions in Division 230 of the Tax 
Act. It is noted that Division 230 will generally not 
apply to the financial arrangements of individuals, 
unless an election has been made for those rules 
toapply.
Class rulings are split into parts being (i) the ruling section 
where the Commissioner of Taxation provides a binding 
ruling on the application of the law and (ii) non-binding 
sections.
There is one issue that will only be addressed in a non-
binding section of the ruling. The issue relates to a rule 
which applies when the issuer of the instrument (here, 
CBA) is entitled to a deduction in a foreign jurisdiction 
in relation to distributions paid on the instrument. It is 
possible that this rule could apply to Distributions paid 
on PERLS XII as a result of the manner in which CBAs 
offshore branches are required to calculate taxable 
income in foreign jurisdictions. The Commissioner of 
Taxation is aware of the potential application of this rule 
and, subject to CBA entering into a deed, has agreed 
to use his general administrative powers to not deny 
Holders the benefit of either franking credits or tax offsets 
in relation to the Distributions. As the Commissioner of 
Taxation is providing this confirmation under his general 
administrative powers, it will be provided in a non-binding 
section of the class ruling. CBA will enter into a deed 
with the Commissioner of Taxation and will provide 
undertakings in relation to the potential application 
of this rule. The deed, and compliance by CBA with its 
undertakings under the deed, will not have any negative 
impact on Holders.
5.4.3 Distributions on PERLS XII
PERLS XII should be characterised as non-share equity 
interests for Australian income tax purposes.
5.4.3.1 Australian resident Holders
Distributions should be treated as non-share dividends 
that are frankable.
Generally, provided that a Holder is a qualified person 
and the ATO does not make a determination under 
the dividend streaming rules to deny the benefit of the 
franking credits to the Holder, the Holder:
 
should include the amount of the Distribution as well 
as an amount equal to the franking credits attached 
to the Distribution in their assessable income in the 
income	year	in	which	they	received	the	Distribution;	
and
 
should qualify for a tax offset equal to the franking 
credits attached to the Distribution which can be 
applied against their income tax liability for the 
relevant income year.
A Holder that is an individual or complying 
superannuation	fund	may	be	able	to	receive	a	cashtax	
refund	from	the	ATO	if	the	tax	offset	equal	to	thefranking	
credits attached to the Distribution exceeds the tax 
payable on the Holders total taxable income. A Holder 
that is a company will not be entitled to a tax refund 
of the excess franking credits. Rather, the surplus 
franking credits may be converted to a tax loss which 
can be carried forward to future years (subject to the 
Holdersatisfying	certain	loss	carry	forward	rules).
A Holder should be a qualified person if the holding 
period rule and the related payments rule are 
satisfied.Generally:
 
to satisfy the holding period rule, a Holder must 
have held their PERLS XII at risk for a continuous 
period of at least 90 days (excluding the day of 
disposal) within a period beginning on the day 
afterthe	day	on	which	they	are	acquired	and	ending	
on the 90th day after they become ex-distribution. To 
be held at risk, a Holder must retain 30% or more 
of the risks and benefits associated with holding 
their PERLS XII. Where a Holder undertakes risk 
management strategies in relation to their PERLS XII 
(e.g. by the use of limited recourse loans, options or 
other derivatives), the Holders ability to satisfy the at 
risk requirement of the holding period rule may be 
affected;	and	
 
under the related payments rule, a Holder who is 
obliged to make a related payment (essentially a 
payment passing on the benefit of the Distribution) 
in respect of a Distribution must hold the PERLS XII 
at risk for at least 90 days (not including the days of 
acquisition and disposal) within each period beginning 
90 days before, and ending 90 days after, they 
become ex-distribution.
A Holder who is an individual is automatically treated 
as a qualified person for these purposes if the total 
amount of the tax offsets in respect of all franked 
amounts to which the Holder is entitled in an income 
year does not exceed A$5,000. This is referred to as the 
small shareholder rule. However, a Holder will not be 
a qualified person under the small shareholder rule if 
related payments have been made, or will be made, in 
respect of such amounts.

Other Information (continued)
Section 5
There are anti-avoidance rules which can deny the benefit 
of franking credits to Holders in certain situations. 
One such rule (in section 207-158 of the Tax Act) applies 
when the issuer of the instrument (here, CBA) is entitled 
to a deduction in a foreign jurisdiction in relation to 
distributions paid on the instrument. It is possible that 
this rule could apply to Distributions paid on PERLS XII 
as a result of how CBAs offshore branches are required 
to calculate taxable income in foreign jurisdictions. The 
Commissioner of Taxation is aware of this issue and, 
subject to CBA entering into a deed, has agreed to use 
his general administrative powers to not deny Holders the 
benefit of either franking credits or tax offsets in relation 
to Distributions. The Commissioner of Taxation will 
confirm this position in the PERLS XII class ruling. CBA 
will enter into a deed with the Commissioner of Taxation 
and will provide undertakings in relation to the potential 
application of section 207-158.
Of the other anti-avoidance rules, the most significant is 
in section 177EA of the Tax Act. The High Court in Andrew 
Vincent Mills v FCT [2012]	HCA51	(Mills) considered the 
operation	of	section	177EAin	the	context	of	the	PERLS	V	
securities issued by CBA on 14 October 2009. The High 
Court unanimously held that section 177EA did not apply 
in	respect	of	frankable	distributions	paid	on	the	PERLS	V	
securities. 
In light of the decision in Mills, and having regard to 
the ATOs current practices, neither section 177EA, nor 
other anti-avoidance rules, should apply to Distributions 
on PERLS XII, subject to the particular circumstances 
ofaHolder.	
5.4.3.2 Non-Australian resident Holders
Distributions should not be subject to Australian  
non-resident withholding tax to the extent the 
Distributions are franked. 
To the extent an unfranked Distribution is paid to 
non-Australian resident Holders, withholding tax will be 
payable. The rate of withholding tax is 30%. However, 
non-Australian resident Holders may be entitled to 
a reduction in the rate of withholding tax if they are 
resident in a country which has a double taxation 
agreement	withAustralia.
5.4.4 Disposal of PERLS XII
5.4.4.1 Disposal other than through Exchange
(a) Australian resident Holders
On the disposal (including on-market disposal, 
Redemption or Resale) of PERLS XII, Australian resident 
Holders will be required to include any gain in their 
assessable income in the income tax year in which the 
disposal occurs. The gain will generally be equal to the 
proceeds from the disposal less the cost of acquisition for 
their PERLS XII. 
As PERLS XII are not traditional securities, 
qualifying Holders (individuals, trusts and complying 
superannuation funds) who have held their PERLS XII for 
at least 12 months prior to disposal may be eligible for 
theCGT	discount	concession	on	any	capital	gain	made	
ondisposal.
The Federal Government has announced that managed 
investment trusts (MITs) and attribution MITs 
(AMITs) will no longer be entitled to the CGT discount 
at the trust level from 1 July 2020. MITs and AMITs that 
derive capital gains will continue to be able to distribute 
those amounts as capital gains that may be subject to the 
CGT discount in the hands of those beneficiaries who are 
entitled to the CGT discount. 
Any loss on the disposal (including an on-market disposal) 
of PERLS XII should give rise to a capital loss for Holders 
under the CGT rules in the Tax Act. Capital losses are 
generally only deductible against capital gains, but can 
becarried	forward	for	use	in	a	later	year.	
If an Australian resident Holder realises a loss from 
an off-market disposal of PERLS XII, they should seek 
their own advice as to whether a loss is allowed in their 
circumstances.  
(b) Non-Australian resident Holders
As PERLS XII are not traditional securities,  
non-Australian resident Holders should generally not 
be taxable on any gain realised on disposal of their 
PERLS XII (as PERLS XII should generally not be taxable 
Australianproperty).	
5.4.4.2 Disposal through Exchange
Under specific provisions of the Tax Act, any gain or loss 
that would arise on Exchange should be disregarded. The 
consequence of this is that the gain or loss is effectively 
deferred, with a Holders cost base in the Ordinary Shares 
acquired on Exchange reflecting the Holders cost base in 
their PERLS XII. This outcome applies both to Australian 
resident Holders and non-Australian resident Holders. 
5.4.5  Ordinary Shares acquired on 
Exchange
5.4.5.1 Australian resident Holders
The taxation treatment of any dividends received on 
Ordinary Shares acquired on Exchange will be broadly 
similar to that discussed in Section 5.4.3.1 Australian 
resident Holders.
The Ordinary Shares will not be traditional securities. 
As such, any gain or loss realised on disposal should be 
taxable under the CGT provisions. For CGT purposes, the 
Ordinary Shares acquired on Exchange will be taken to 
have been acquired on the Exchange Date. This means 
that the Ordinary Shares would need to be held for at 
least 12 months after the Exchange Date in order for 
qualifying Holders (individuals, trusts and complying 
superannuation funds) to be eligible for the CGT discount 
concession on a subsequent disposal. 
5.4.5.2 Non-Australian resident Holders
The tax treatment of any dividends received on Ordinary 
Shares will be broadly similar to that discussed in  
Section 5.4.3.2 Non-Australian resident Holders.
Non-Australian resident Holders should generally not be 
taxable on any gain realised on disposal of their Ordinary 
Shares (as the Ordinary Shares should generally not be 
taxable Australian property).

PERLS XII Prospectus
5.4.6  Provision of TFN and/or ABN
The Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) imposes 
withholding tax (currently at the rate of 47%) on the 
payment of distributions on certain types of investments 
such as the unfranked part (if any) of Distributions. 
However, where a Holder has provided CBA with their 
TFN or, in certain circumstances, their ABN, or has 
notified CBA that they are exempt from providing this 
information, CBA is not required to withhold any amount 
on account of tax from payments.
A Holder is not required to provide their TFN or ABN to 
CBA.
5.4.7 GST
GST is not payable on the issue, receipt, disposal, 
Exchange, Redemption or Resale of PERLS XII.
GST is not payable in relation to the payment of 
Distributions,	or	repayment	of	the	Face	Value,	by	CBA.
5.4.8 Stamp duty
No stamp duty should be payable on the issue, receipt, 
disposal, Exchange, Redemption or Resale of PERLS XII. 
5.5 
US Persons
PERLS XII have not been and will not be registered under 
the US Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or 
other jurisdiction of the United States. They may not be 
offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in the United States 
or to, or for the account or benefit of, any US Person, 
unless an exemption from such registration applies. Any 
offer, sale or resale of PERLS XII within the United States 
by any dealer (whether or not participating in the Offer)

Form
(a) PERLS XII are perpetual, subordinated, unsecured 
notes of CBA, issued in registered form by entry in the

(b) Each entry in the Register evidences a separate 
and independent obligation which CBA owes to 
the relevant Holder, which that Holder may enforce 
without joining any other Holder or any previous 
Holder.
(c) No certificates will be issued to Holders unless CBA is 
required to provide certificates by any applicable law 
or regulation.
1.2

CHESS
While PERLS XII remain in CHESS, all dealings (including 
transfers and payments) in relation to PERLS XII within 
CHESS, and the rights and obligations of each Holder, 
are subject to the rules and regulations of CHESS. 
To the extent there are inconsistencies between the 
rules and regulations of CHESS and the Terms, the 
Terms prevail.

CBA must use all reasonable endeavours to procure that 
PERLS XII are quoted on ASX on or as soon as possible 
after the Issue Date.
1.5 
 Payment and ranking in a winding up 
of CBA
(a) If an order is made by a court of competent 
jurisdiction in Australia (other than an order 
successfully appealed or permanently stayed within 
30 days), or an effective resolution is passed, for the 
winding up of CBA in Australia, CBA must redeem 
each PERLS XII for its Face Value in accordance with 
this clause.
(b) Holders do not have any right to prove in a winding 
up of CBA in respect of PERLS XII, other than a right to 
prove in a winding up of CBA in Australia as permitted 
under clauses 1.5(c) and 1.5(d).
(c) Each PERLS XII ranks for payment in a winding up of 
CBA in Australia:
(i) after the claims of all holders of Senior Ranking 
Obligations;
(ii) equally with each Holder and holders of Equal 
Ranking Securities; and
(iii) ahead of holders of Junior Ranking Securities.
(d) In order to give effect to the ranking specified in 
clause 1.5(c), in any winding up of CBA in Australia, the 
claims of Holders are limited to the extent necessary 
to ensure that:
(i) all holders of Senior Ranking Obligations receive 
payment in full before any payment is made to 
Holders; and
(ii) Holders of PERLS XII and holders of any Equal 
Ranking Securities receive payments on a pro-rata 
basis. 
(e) Nothing in this clause limits the ability of CBA to, 
in its absolute discretion from time to time, issue 
further Senior Ranking Obligations or Equal Ranking 
Securities. 
(f) Holders may not exercise voting rights as a creditor in 
respect of PERLS XII in a winding up of CBA to defeat 
the subordination in this clause.
(g) PERLS XII are perpetual and the Terms do not include 
events of default or any other provisions entitling the 
Holders to require that PERLS XII be Redeemed other 
than under this clause 1.5. Holders do not have any

CBA, or to cause a receiver, or receiver and manager, 
to be appointed in respect of CBA, on the ground 
of CBAs failure to pay Distributions or for any other 
reason.
(h) To avoid doubt but subject to clause 4.6, if a Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event has 
occurred, Holders will rank for payment in a winding

PERLS XII Prospectus
(b) Interest on each PERLS XII is payable in arrears on 
each Distribution Payment Date. 
(c) Payment of interest on each PERLS XII is subject to 
clauses 2.5, 2.6 and 9. 
2.2 
Distribution Rate determination
The Distribution Rate (expressed as a percentage per 
annum) for each Distribution Period is the rate calculated 
according to the following formula:
Distribution Rate =
(Market Rate + Margin) x (1  Tax Rate)
where:
Market Rate means 
(a) subject to paragraph (b), the Bank Bill Swap Reference 
Rate administered by ASX Benchmarks Pty Limited 
(or any other person that takes on the administration 
of that rate) expressed as a percentage per annum for 
a term of 3 months as displayed on the BBSW page 
published through information vendors (or any page 
that replaces that page) on the first Business Day of 
the Distribution Period, provided that where PERLS XII 
are Resold, Exchanged or Redeemed on a day which 
is not a scheduled Distribution Payment Date, and a 
Distribution is payable, then the Market Rate for the 
Distribution Period commencing on the Resale Date, 
Exchange Date or Redemption Date (as applicable) in 
respect of such PERLS XII shall be the Market Rate for 
the Distribution Period preceding the relevant Resale 
Date, Exchange Date, or Redemption Date; and
(b) if CBA determines that a Market Rate Disruption Event 
has occurred, then, CBA shall: 
(i) use as the Market Rate such Alternative Market 
Rate as it may determine; and
(ii) make such adjustments to the Terms as it 
determines to be reasonably necessary to calculate 
Distributions in accordance with such Alternative 
Market Rate;
provided that APRA's prior written approval will be 
required in respect of any such adjustment arising 
from an event that is specified in paragraph (iii) or (iv) 
of the definition of "Market Rate Disruption Event" in 
clause 2.2(d); and
(c) in making the above determinations in paragraph (b), 
CBA:
(i) shall act in good faith and in a commercially 
reasonable manner; 
(ii) may consult such sources of market practice as it 
considers appropriate; and 
(iii) may otherwise make such determination in its 
discretion. 
(d) For the purposes of this clause:
Market Rate Disruption Event occurs when, in 
CBA's opinion, the Market Rate in paragraph (a) of the 
definition:
(i) is not published by 10:30am or such other time 
that CBA considers appropriate on that day; 
(ii) is published but is affected by an obvious error; 
(iii) has been discontinued or otherwise ceased to be 
calculated or administered; or  
(iv) is no longer generally accepted in the Australian 
market as a reference rate appropriate to floating 
rate debt securities of a tenor and interest period 
comparable to that of PERLS XII. 
Alternative Market Rate means a rate other than 
the rate described in paragraph (a) of the definition 
of Market Rate, that is, in CBA's opinion, generally 
accepted in the Australian market as the successor to 
the Market Rate, or if there is no such rate: 
(a) a reference rate that is, in CBA's opinion, 
appropriate to floating rate debt securities of a 
tenor and interest period most comparable to 
PERLS XII; or
(b) such other reference rate as CBA considers 
appropriate having regard to available comparable 
indices; and 
provided that, CBA reserves the discretion to 
incorporate an adjustment (which may be positive 
or negative) or a formula or methodology for 
calculating such an adjustment in order to reduce or 
eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit to 
Holders as a result of the use of an Alternative Market 
Rate. APRAs prior written approval will be required 
in respect of the Alternative Market Rate or any such 
adjustment arising from an event that is specified in 
paragraph (iii) or (iv) of the definition of "Market Rate 
Disruption Event" in this clause.
Margin means the rate (expressed as a percentage per 
annum) determined under the Bookbuild; and
Tax Rate means the Australian corporate tax rate on 
the relevant Distribution Payment Date (expressed as a 
decimal).
2.3 
Calculation of Distributions
The Distribution payable on each PERLS XII for each 
Distribution Period is calculated according to the following 
formula:
Distribution 
payable
= Distribution Rate x Face Value x N
365
where:
N means, in respect of a Distribution Period, the number 
of days in that Distribution Period.
2.4 
 Adjustment to calculation of 
Distributions if not fully franked
If any Distribution is not franked to 100% under Part 
3-6 of the Tax Act, the Distribution will be calculated 
according to the following formula:
Distribution payable =
D
1 - [T  (1 - F)]

T means the Australian corporate tax rate on the relevant 
Distribution Payment Date (expressed as a decimal); and
F means the franking percentage (as defined in Part 3-6 
of the Tax Act) applicable to the franking account of CBA 
on the relevant Distribution Payment Date (expressed as 
a decimal).
2.5 
Distribution payment conditions
The payment of any Distribution on any Distribution 
Payment Date is subject to:
(a) CBA, in its absolute discretion, making the Distribution 
to Holders; 
(b) the payment of the Distribution not resulting in a 
breach of CBAs capital requirements under APRAs 
prudential standards as they are applied to the CBA 
Level 1 Group or the CBA Level 2 Group or both at the 
time of the payment; 
(c) the payment of the Distribution not resulting in CBA 
becoming, or being likely to become, Insolvent; and
(d) APRA not otherwise objecting to the payment of the 
Distribution.
No Distribution will be paid on Exchange where Exchange 
occurs due to a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability 
Trigger Event.
CBA must notify ASX at least five Business Days before 
the relevant Record Date (or, if later, as soon as it 
decides not to make the Distribution) if payment of any 
Distribution will not be made because of this clause. 
2.6 
 Distributions are discretionary and 
non-cumulative
Distributions are discretionary and non-cumulative. If 
payment of any Distribution is not made for any reason, 
CBA has no liability to pay that unpaid Distribution. 
2.7 
 Dividend and capital restrictions in the 
event of non-payment
(a) Subject to clause 2.7(b), if any Distribution is not paid 
to Holders in full on the relevant Distribution Payment 
Date, then CBA must not, without the approval of a 
Special Resolution:
(i) declare or determine a dividend; or
(ii) return any capital or undertake any buy-backs or 
repurchases,
(together Restricted Actions) in relation to any 
Ordinary Shares, unless the amount of any unpaid 
Distribution is paid in full within five Business Days of 
that date. If, on a subsequent Distribution Payment 
Date, a Distribution is paid in full, or if all PERLS 
XII have been Exchanged, Redeemed or otherwise 
terminated, then these restrictions cease to apply.
(b) Clause 2.7(a) does not apply to:
(i) Restricted Actions which CBA is legally obliged to 
pay or complete at the time any Distribution is not 
paid in full to Holders on a relevant Distribution 
Payment Date; or
(ii) Restricted Actions in connection with:
(A) any employment contract, employee share 
scheme, employee rights or option plan, or 
similar arrangement with, or for the benefit of, 
any one or more employees, officers, directors 
or consultants of CBA or its Related Bodies 
Corporate; or
(B) CBA or any of its Related Bodies Corporate 
purchasing Ordinary Shares in connection with 
transactions for the account of customers of 
CBA or customers of any of its Related Bodies 
Corporate.
2.8 
 Notification of Distribution Rate, 
Distribution payable and other items
(a) CBA must notify ASX of the Distribution Rate, amount 
of Distribution payable and Distribution Payment Date 
for each Distribution Period.
(b) CBA must give notice under this clause as soon as 
practicable after it makes its calculations and by no 
later than the fourth Business Day of the relevant 
Distribution Period.
(c) CBA may amend its calculation or determination of any 
date, rate or amount (or make appropriate alternative 
arrangements by way of adjustment) including as a 
result of the extension or reduction of the Distribution 
Period or calculation period without prior notice but 
must notify ASX promptly after doing so.
2.9 
Determination final
CBAs determination of all dates, rates and amounts under 
these Terms is, in the absence of wilful default, bad faith 
or manifest error, final and binding on CBA, the Registry 
and each Holder.
2.10 
Calculations
For the purposes of any calculations required under these 
Terms:
(a) all percentages resulting from the calculations 
must be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one 
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with 
0.000005% being rounded up to 0.00001%);
(b) all figures must be rounded to four decimal places 
(with 0.00005 being rounded up to 0.0001); and 
(c) all amounts that are due and payable must be 
rounded to the nearest one Australian cent (with one 
half of an Australian cent being rounded up to one 
Australian cent).

Mandatory Exchange
3.1 
Mandatory Exchange
Subject to clauses 4.1, 4.2, 4.6 and 5, CBA must Exchange 
all (but not some) PERLS XII on issue on the date that is 
the earlier of:
(a) 20 April 2029 (Scheduled Mandatory Exchange 
Date); and
(b) the first Distribution Payment Date after the 
Scheduled Mandatory Exchange Date,
(each a Mandatory Exchange Date) on which the 
Mandatory Exchange Conditions are satisfied.

Mandatory Exchange Conditions
(a) The Mandatory Exchange Conditions for each 
Mandatory Exchange Date are:
(i) the VWAP on the 25th Business Day on which 
trading in Ordinary Shares took place immediately 
preceding (but not including) the Mandatory 
Exchange Date is greater than 56% of the 
Issue Date VWAP (First Mandatory Exchange 
Condition); 
(ii) the VWAP during the period of 20 Business Days 
on which trading in Ordinary Shares took place 
immediately preceding (but not including) the 
Mandatory Exchange Date is greater than 50.51% 
of the Issue Date VWAP (the Second Mandatory 
Exchange Condition); and
(iii) Ordinary Shares have not been Delisted as at the 
Mandatory Exchange Date (Third Mandatory 
Exchange Condition).
(b) If the First Mandatory Exchange Condition is not 
satisfied, CBA will announce to ASX between the 
25th and the 21st Business Day before the Mandatory 
Exchange Date that Exchange will not proceed on the 
Mandatory Exchange Date.
(c) If the Second Mandatory Exchange Condition or Third 
Mandatory Exchange Condition is not satisfied, CBA 
will notify Holders on or as soon as practicable after 
the Mandatory Exchange Date that Exchange did not 
occur.
4 
Early Exchange
4.1 
Capital Trigger Event
(a) A Capital Trigger Event occurs when:
(i) CBA determines; or 
(ii) APRA notifies CBA in writing that it believes, 
that either or both the CBA Level 1 Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital Ratio or CBA Level 2 Common Equity 
Tier 1 Capital Ratio is equal to or less than 5.125%. CBA 
must immediately notify APRA in writing if it makes a 
determination under clause 4.1(a)(i).
(b) If a Capital Trigger Event occurs, CBA must Exchange 
such number of PERLS XII (or, if it so determines, 
such percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII) 
as is sufficient (taking into account any exchange, 
conversion or write down of Relevant Securities as 
referred to in paragraph (c) below) to return either or 
both the CBA Level 1 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 
Ratio or CBA Level 2 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 
Ratio, as the case may be, to above 5.125%.
(c) In determining the number of PERLS XII, or 
percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII, which 
must be Exchanged in accordance with this clause, 
CBA will:
(i) firstly, exchange, convert or write down the face 
value of any Relevant Securities whose terms 
require or permit, or are taken by law to require 
or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or 
written down before Exchange of PERLS XII; and
(ii) secondly, if exchange, conversion or write down 
of those Relevant Securities is not sufficient, 
Exchange (in the case of PERLS XII) or exchange, 
convert or write down (in the case of any other 
Relevant Securities) on a pro-rata basis or in a 
manner that is otherwise, in the opinion of CBA, 
fair and reasonable, PERLS XII and any Relevant 
Securities whose terms require or permit, or are 
taken by law to require or permit, them to be 
Exchanged, converted or written down in that 
manner (subject to such adjustment as CBA 
may determine to take into account the effect 
on marketable parcels and whole numbers of 
Ordinary Shares and any PERLS XII or other 
Relevant Securities remaining on issue),
but such determination will not impede the 
immediate Exchange of the relevant number of 
PERLS XII or percentage of the Face Value of each 
PERLS XII (as the case may be).
(d) For the purposes of clauses 4.1(b) and 4.1(c), where 
the specified currency of the face value of Relevant 
Securities and/or PERLS XII is not the same, CBA may 
treat them as if converted into a single currency of 
CBAs choice at such rate of exchange as CBA in good 
faith considers reasonable.
(e) If a Capital Trigger Event occurs:
(i) the relevant number of PERLS XII, or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII, must be 
Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of the 
Capital Trigger Event in accordance with clauses 
4.5 and 7 and the Exchange will be irrevocable;
(ii) CBA must give notice as soon as practicable that 
Exchange has occurred to ASX and the Holders; 
(iii) the notice must specify the date on which the 
Capital Trigger Event occurred; and
(iv) the notice must specify the details of the Exchange 
process, including any details which were taken 
into account in relation to the effect on marketable 
parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, 
and the impact on any PERLS XII remaining on 
issue.
Failure to undertake any of the steps in clauses 4.1(e)
(ii) to (iv) does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise 
impede Exchange.
4.2 
Non-Viability Trigger Event
(a) A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA 
notifies CBA in writing that it believes:
(i) Exchange of all or some PERLS XII, or exchange, 
conversion or write down of capital instruments of 
the CBA Group, is necessary because, without it, 
CBA would become non-viable; or
(ii) a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, CBA 
would become non-viable.
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital 
instruments which must be Exchanged, converted or 
written down (as applicable).

(b) If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, CBA must 
Exchange such number of PERLS XII (or, if it so 
determines, such percentage of the Face Value of 
each PERLS XII) as is equal (taking into account any 
exchange, conversion or write down of Relevant 
Securities as referred to in paragraph (c) below) 
to the aggregate face value of capital instruments 
which APRA has notified CBA must be Exchanged, 
converted or written down (or, if APRA has not so 
notified CBA, such number or, if CBA so determines, 
such percentage of the Face Value of each PERLSXII, 
as is necessary to satisfy APRA that CBA will no 
longer be non-viable). If a Non-Viability Trigger Event 
occurs under clause 4.2(a)(ii), CBA must Exchange all 
PERLSXII.
(c) In determining the number of PERLS XII, or 
percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII, which 
must be Exchanged in accordance with this clause, 
CBA will:
(i) firstly, exchange, convert or write down the face 
value of any Relevant Securities whose terms 
require or permit, or are taken by law to require 
or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or 
written down before Exchange of PERLS XII; and
(ii) secondly, if exchange, conversion or write down 
of those securities is not sufficient, Exchange 
(in the case of PERLS XII) or exchange, convert 
or write down (in the case of any other Relevant 
Securities), on a pro-rata basis or in a manner 
that is otherwise, in the opinion of CBA, fair and 
reasonable, PERLS XII and any Relevant Securities 
whose terms require or permit, or are taken by 
law to require or permit, them to be Exchanged, 
converted or written down in that manner (subject 
to such adjustments as CBA may determine to 
take into account the effect on marketable parcels 
and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares and any 
PERLS XII or other Relevant Securities remaining 
on issue),
but such determination will not impede the 
immediate Exchange of the relevant number of PERLS 
XII or percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII 
(as the case may be).
(d) For the purposes of clauses 4.2(b) and 4.2(c), where 
the specified currency of the face value of Relevant 
Securities and/or PERLS XII is not the same, CBA may 
treat them as if converted into a single currency of 
CBAs choice at such rate of exchange as CBA in good 
faith considers reasonable.
(e) If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs:
(i) the relevant number of PERLS XII, or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII, must be 
Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of 
the Non-Viability Trigger Event in accordance 
with clauses 4.5 and 7 and the Exchange will be 
irrevocable;
(ii) CBA must give notice as soon as practicable that 
Exchange has occurred to ASX and the Holders;
(iii) the notice must specify the date on which the 
Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred; and
(iv) the notice must specify the details of the Exchange 
process, including any details which were taken 
into account in relation to the effect on marketable 
parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, and 
the impact on any PERLS XII remaining on issue.
Failure to undertake any of the steps in clauses 4.2(e)
(ii) to (iv) does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise 
impede Exchange.
4.3 
 Mandatory Exchange Conditions do not 
apply to Capital Trigger Event or Non-
Viability Trigger Event 
For the avoidance of doubt, the Mandatory Exchange 
Conditions do not apply to Exchange as a result of a 
Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
occurring.
4.4 
Priority of Early Exchange Obligations 
An Exchange required because of a Capital Trigger 
Event or a Non-Viability Trigger Event takes place 
notwithstanding anything in clause 3.
4.5 
 Automatic Exchange upon the 
occurrence of a Capital Trigger Event 
or Non-Viability Trigger Event
If a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
has occurred and all or some PERLS XII (or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII) are required to be 
Exchanged in accordance with clauses 4.1 or 4.2, then: 
(a) Exchange of the relevant PERLS XII or percentage 
of the Face Value of each PERLS XII will occur in 
accordance with clause 7 immediately upon the date 
of occurrence of the Capital Trigger Event or Non-
Viability Trigger Event; and
(b) the entry of the corresponding PERLS XII in each 
relevant Holders holding in the Register will constitute 
an entitlement of that Holder to the relevant 
number of Ordinary Shares (and, if applicable, also 
to any remaining balance of PERLS XII or remaining 
percentage of the Face Value of each PERLS XII), and 
CBA will recognise the Holder as having been issued 
the relevant Ordinary Shares for all purposes,
in each case without the need for any further act or step 
by CBA, the Holder or any other person (and CBA will, as 
soon as possible thereafter and without delay on the part 
of CBA, take any appropriate procedural steps to record 
such Exchange, including updating the Register and the 
Ordinary Share register and seek quotation of Ordinary 
Shares issued on Exchange). 
For the avoidance of doubt:
(c) nothing in this clause allows a payment to be made to 
a Holder upon Exchange; and
(d) Exchange under this clause takes priority over a notice 
for Redemption issued under clauses 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4.

4.6 
 No further rights if Exchange cannot 
occur
If, for any reason, Exchange of any PERLS XII (or a 
percentage of the Face Value of any PERLS XII) required 
to be Exchanged under clauses 4.1 or 4.2 fails to take 
effect under clauses 4.5(a) and 4.5(b) and CBA has not 
otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be 
issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business 
Days after the date of the occurrence of the Capital 
Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the 
relevant Holders rights (including to payment of the Face 
Value and Distributions, and the right to receive Ordinary 
Shares) in relation to such PERLS XII or percentage of the 
Face Value of PERLS XII are immediately and irrevocably 
terminated and such termination will be taken to have 
occurred immediately on the date of the occurrence of 
the Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
CBA must give notice as soon as practicable that such 
termination has occurred to the Holders and such notice 
must be announced on ASX, and the notice must specify 
the date on which the Capital Trigger Event or Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurred.
4.7 
Change of Control Event 
(a) A Change of Control Event occurs when:
(i) a takeover bid is made for Ordinary Shares 
(A) acceptance of which is recommended by the 
Board and which is or has become unconditional or 
(B) which is or has become unconditional and the 
voting power of the offeror in CBA is or has become 
greater than 50%; or 
(ii) in respect of a scheme of arrangement under 
Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act which would 
result (if implemented) in a person having voting 
power in more than 50% of CBA, the earlier of 
(A) a court approving the scheme, and (B) the 
Board determining that such event should be 
treated as a Change of Control Event for the 
purposes of this clause,
provided that clause 4.7(a)(ii) does not include a 
scheme of arrangement which would result in a NOHC 
Event.
(b) If a Change of Control Event occurs, then:
(i) CBA must Exchange all (but not some) PERLS XII;
(ii) CBA must give notice as soon as practicable and in 
any event within 10 Business Days after becoming 
aware of that event occurring to ASX and the 
Holders; 
(iii) the notice must specify a date on which it 
is proposed Exchange will occur (proposed 
Exchange Date) being:
(1) in the case of a Change of Control Event under 
clause 4.7(a)(i), no later than the Business Day 
prior to the then announced closing date of the 
relevant takeover bid; 
(2) in the case of a Change of Control Event under 
clause 4.7(a)(ii)(A), a date no later than the 
record date for participation in the relevant 
scheme of arrangement; or
(3) in the case of a Change of Control Event under 
clause 4.7(a)(ii)(B), a date no later than 25 
Business Days following the date the notice is 
given, or the record date for participation in the 
relevant scheme of arrangement, whichever is 
earlier; and
(iv) the notice must specify the details of the Exchange 
process including any details to take into account 
the effect on marketable parcels and whole 
numbers of Ordinary Shares; and
(v) on the proposed Exchange Date, all PERLS XII will 
Exchange in accordance with clause 7.
(c) The Second Mandatory Exchange Condition and Third 
Mandatory Exchange Condition apply if a Change 
of Control Event occurs as though the proposed 
Exchange Date were a Mandatory Exchange Date for 
the purposes of clause 4 (except that in the case of 
a Change of Control Event, the Second Mandatory 
Exchange Condition will apply as if it referred to 
20.20% of the Issue Date VWAP). 
(d) If either the Second Mandatory Exchange Condition or 
Third Mandatory Exchange Condition is not satisfied 
on the proposed Exchange Date: 
(i) PERLS XII must Exchange on the next Distribution 
Payment Date on which the Second Mandatory 
Exchange Condition and Third Mandatory 
Exchange Condition are satisfied; and
(ii) CBA will notify Holders as soon as practicable after 
the proposed Exchange Date that Exchange did 
not occur.
4.8 
 No Exchange at the option of the 
Holders
Holders do not have a right to request Exchange of their 
PERLS XII at any time.
5 
Early Redemption
5.1 
 Early Redemption at the option of CBA 
on the Call Date
CBA may at its option Redeem all or some PERLS XII on 
the Call Date for their Face Value. 
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if 
CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business Days) 
before the Call Date to ASX and the Holders.
If only some (but not all) PERLS XII are to be Redeemed 
under this clause, those PERLS XII to be Redeemed will 
be specified in the notice and selected:
(a) in a manner that is, in the opinion of CBA, fair and 
reasonable; and
(b) in compliance with any applicable law, directive or 
requirement of ASX.

 Early Redemption for inability to frank 
Distributions
If there is a material risk that as a result of any change in, 
or amendment to, the laws of Australia, or their application 
or official or judicial interpretation or administration 
(including any announcement of a prospective change or 
amendment which has been or will be introduced), which 
change or amendment was not expected by CBA as at the 
Issue Date and has or is expected to become effective on 
or after the Issue Date, any Distribution would not be a 
frankable distribution within the meaning of Division 202 
of the Tax Act, CBA may Redeem all (but not some) 
PERLS XII for their Face Value.
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if:
(a) CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the proposed Redemption Date to ASX 
and the Holders;
(b) the proposed Redemption Date is a Distribution 
Payment Date; and
(c) the notice of Redemption is not given earlier than 
60 Business Days before the Distribution Payment Date 
occurring immediately before the earliest date on which 
a Distribution would not be a frankable Distribution.
5.3 
 Early Redemption for other taxation 
reasons
If CBA receives an opinion from reputable legal counsel or 
other tax adviser in Australia, experienced in such matters, 
to the effect that there is a material risk that as a result 
of a change in, or amendment to, the laws of Australia, 
or their application or official or judicial interpretation 
or administration (including any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or 
will be introduced), which change or amendment was 
not expected by CBA at the Issue Date and becomes or is 
expected to become effective on or after the Issue Date: 
(a) CBA would be required to pay an increased amount 
under clause 9.6; or
(b) CBA would be exposed to a more than de minimis 
adverse tax consequence in relation to PERLS XII other 
than a tax consequence that CBA expected as at the 
Issue Date, 
CBA may Redeem all (but not some) PERLS XII for their 
Face Value.
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if:
(c) CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the proposed Redemption Date to ASX 
and the Holders;
(d) the proposed Redemption Date is a Distribution 
Payment Date; and
(e) the notice of Redemption is not given earlier than 
60 Business Days before the Distribution Payment 
Date occurring immediately before the earliest date 
on which CBA would be subject to the adverse tax 
consequence.
5.4 
 Early redemption for regulatory 
reasons
If, at any time after the Issue Date, CBA determines that 
as a result of a change in, or amendment to, the laws of 
Australia or APRAs prudential standards or guidelines, 
or in their application or official or judicial interpretation 
or administration (including any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or will 
be introduced), all, some or a proportion of all or some 
PERLS XII are not or will not be treated as Tier 1 Capital 
of the CBA Group under APRAs prudential standards (as 
amended from time to time), other than as a result of 
a change of treatment expected by CBA as at the Issue 
Date, CBA may Redeem all (but not some) PERLS XII for 
their Face Value.
However, CBA may only Redeem under this clause if:
(a) CBA has given notice of its election to do so at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the proposed Redemption Date to ASX 
and the Holders;
(b) the proposed Redemption Date is a Distribution 
Payment Date; and
(c) the notice of Redemption is not given earlier than 
60 Business Days before the Distribution Payment 
Date occurring immediately before the earliest date 
on which all, some or a proportion of all or some 
PERLS XII will cease to be treated as Tier 1 Capital.
5.5 
APRA approval to Redeem
CBA may only Redeem under this clause 5 if:
(a) either:
(i) before or concurrently with Redemption, CBA 
replaces PERLS XII with a capital instrument which 
is of the same or better quality (for the purposes 
of APRAs prudential standards as they are applied 
to the CBA Group at the relevant time) than 
PERLS XII and the replacement of PERLS XII is 
done under conditions that are sustainable for the 
income capacity of CBA; or
(ii) CBA obtains confirmation from APRA that APRA 
is satisfied, having regard to the capital position of 
the CBA Level 1 Group and CBA Level 2 Group, that 
CBA does not have to replace PERLS XII; and
(b) APRA has given its prior written approval to the 
Redemption. Approval is at the discretion of APRA and 
may or may not be given.
5.6 
Final Distribution
For the avoidance of doubt, Redemption may occur even 
if CBA, in its absolute discretion, does not make the 
Distribution for the final Distribution Period. 
5.7 
 No Redemption at the option of the 
Holders
Holders do not have a right to request Redemption of 
their PERLS XII at any time.
5.8 
Effect of notice of Redemption
Any notice of Redemption given under this clause 5 is 
irrevocable and CBA must (subject to clauses 1.5, 4.5(d) 
and 9.3) Redeem PERLS XII on the Redemption Date 
specified in that notice.

Resale on the Call Date
(a) CBA may elect that Resale occur in relation to all or 
some PERLS XII by giving a Resale Notice at least 
20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business 
Days) before the Call Date to ASX and the Holders.
If only some (but not all) PERLS XII are to be Resold 
under this clause, the number of PERLS XII to be 
Resold will be specified in the notice and selected:
(i) in a manner that is, in the opinion of CBA, fair and 
reasonable; and
(ii) in compliance with any applicable law, directive or 
requirement of ASX.
(b) If CBA issues a Resale Notice:
(i) each Holder is taken irrevocably to offer to sell the 
relevant number of their PERLS XII to the Purchaser 
on the Call Date (Resale Date) for a cash amount 
per PERLS XII equal to the Face Value (and to 
have appointed CBA as its agent and attorney to 
do and execute all things and documents which 
CBA considers may be necessary or desirable in 
connection with that offer and any resulting sale); 
(ii) subject to payment by the Purchaser of the Face 
Value to Holders, all right, title and interest in the 
relevant number of PERLS XII will be transferred 
from the Holders to the Purchaser on the Resale 
Date; and
(iii) if the Purchaser does not pay the Face Value to the 
relevant Holders on the Resale Date, the relevant 
number of PERLS XII will not be transferred to the 
Purchaser and a Holder has no claim on CBA as a 
result of that non-payment.
(c) Clause 9 will apply to payments by the Purchaser 
as if the Purchaser was CBA. If any payment to a 
particular Holder is not made or treated as made on 
the Resale Date because of any error by or on behalf 
of the Purchaser, the relevant PERLS XII of that Holder 
will not be transferred until payment is made but the 
transfer of all other relevant PERLS will not be affected 
by the failure.
7 
 General provisions 
applicable to Exchange
7.1 
Exchange
On the Exchange Date, subject to clauses 4.6 and 7.10, the 
following will apply:
(a) CBA will allot and issue the Exchange Number of 
Ordinary Shares for each PERLS XII held by the Holder. 
The Exchange Number is calculated according to the 
following formula, and subject always to the Exchange 
Number being no greater than the Maximum 
Exchange Number:
Exchange Number 
for each PERLS XII =
Face Value
0.99  VWAP
where:
VWAP (expressed in dollars and cents) means the 
VWAP during the VWAP Period.
Maximum Exchange Number means a number 
calculated according to the following formula:
Maximum Exchange 
Number 
=
Face Value
Relevant Percentage  
Issue Date VWAP
where:
Relevant Percentage means:
(i) if Exchange is occurring on a Mandatory Exchange 
Date, 0.50; and 
(ii) if Exchange is occurring at any other time, 0.20.
(b) Each Holders rights (including to payment of 
Distributions, other than the Distribution, if any, 
payable on an Exchange Date where the Exchange is 
not as a result of a Capital Trigger Event or a Non-
Viability Trigger Event) in relation to each PERLS XII 
that is being Exchanged will be immediately and 
irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the 
Face Value and CBA will apply the Face Value of each 
PERLS XII by way of payment for the subscription for 
the Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued under 
clause 7.1 (a). Each Holder is taken to have irrevocably 
directed that any amount payable under this clause 7.1 
is to be applied as provided for in this clause and no 
Holder has any right to payment in any other way.
(c) If the total number of additional Ordinary Shares to be 
allotted and issued in respect of a Holders aggregate 
holding of PERLS XII includes a fraction of an Ordinary 
Share, that fraction of an Ordinary Share will be 
disregarded.
7.2 
Adjustments to VWAP generally
For the purposes of calculating VWAP under clause 7.1:
(a) where, on some or all of the Business Days in the 
relevant VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been 
quoted on ASX as cum dividend or cum any other 
distribution or entitlement and PERLS XII will be 
Exchanged for Ordinary Shares after that date and 
those Ordinary Shares will no longer carry that 
dividend or any other distribution or entitlement, 
then the VWAP on the Business Days on which those 
Ordinary Shares have been quoted cum dividend 
or cum any other distribution or entitlement will be 
reduced by an amount (Cum Value) equal to:
(i) in the case of a dividend or other distribution, the 
amount of that dividend or other distribution; 
(ii) in the case of any other entitlement that is not a 
dividend or other distribution under clause 7.2(a)(i) 
which is traded on ASX on any of those Business 
Days, the volume weighted average price of all 
such entitlements sold on ASX during the VWAP 
Period on the Business Days on which those 
entitlements were traded (excluding trades of the 
kind that would be excluded in determining VWAP 
under the definition of that term); or

(iii) in the case of any other entitlement which is not 
traded on ASX during the VWAP Period, the value 
of the entitlement as reasonably determined by 
the Board; and
(b) where, on some or all of the Business Days in the 
VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted as 
ex dividend or ex any other distribution or entitlement, 
and PERLS XII will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares 
which would be entitled to receive the relevant 
dividend, distribution or entitlement, the VWAP on the 
Business Days on which those Ordinary Shares have 
been quoted ex dividend or ex any other distribution 
or entitlement will be increased by the Cum Value.
7.3 
 Adjustments to VWAP for capital 
reconstruction
(a) Where during the relevant VWAP Period there is a 
change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue 
because the Ordinary Shares are reconstructed, 
consolidated, divided or reclassified (not involving any 
payment or other compensation to or by the holders 
of Ordinary Shares) (Reclassification) into a lesser or 
greater number, the daily VWAP for each day in the 
VWAP Period which falls before the date on which 
trading in Ordinary Shares is conducted on a post 
Reclassification basis will be adjusted by multiplying 
the applicable VWAP by the following formula:
A
B
Where:
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares 
immediately before the Reclassification; and
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares 
immediately after the Reclassification. 
(b) Any adjustment made by CBA in accordance with 
clause 7.3(a) will be effective and binding on Holders 
under these Terms and these Terms will be construed 
accordingly. 
(c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 
allows a cash payment or other distribution to be 
made to or by a Holder as part of a Reclassification or 
as a result of a Reclassification.
7.4 
 Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
generally
For the purposes of determining the Issue Date VWAP 
under clause 7.1, adjustments will be made in accordance 
with clauses 7.2 and 7.3 during the VWAP Period for 
the Issue Date VWAP. On and from the Issue Date, 
adjustments to the Issue Date VWAP:
(a) may be made by CBA in accordance with clauses 7.5 to 
7.7 (inclusive);
(b) if so made, will correspondingly affect the application 
of the Mandatory Exchange Conditions and cause an 
adjustment to the Maximum Exchange Number; and
(c) if so made, will be effective and binding on Holders 
under these Terms and these Terms will be construed 
accordingly.
7.5 
 Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
bonus issues
(a) Subject to clauses 7.5(b) and 7.5(c), if CBA makes a 
pro-rata bonus issue of Ordinary Shares to holders 
of Ordinary Shares generally, the Issue Date VWAP 
will be adjusted immediately in accordance with the 
following formula:
V = Vo x RD/(RD + RN)
Where:
V 
 means the Issue Date VWAP applying 
immediately after the application of this formula;
Vo 
 means the Issue Date VWAP applying 
immediately prior to the application of this 
formula;
RD  means the number of Ordinary Shares on issue 
immediately prior to the allotment of new 
Ordinary Shares pursuant to the bonus issue; and
RN  means the number of Ordinary Shares issued 
pursuant to the bonus issue.
(b) Clause 7.5(a) does not apply to Ordinary Shares issued 
as part of a bonus share plan, employee or executive 
share plan, executive option plan, share top up plan, 
share purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment plan.
(c) For the purposes of this clause 7.5, an issue will be 
regarded as a bonus issue notwithstanding that 
CBA does not make offers to some or all holders of 
Ordinary Shares with registered addresses outside 
Australia (or to whom an offer is otherwise subject to 
foreign securities laws), provided that in so doing CBA 
is not in contravention of ASX Listing Rules.
7.6 
 Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
capital reconstruction
If at any time after the Issue Date there is a change to 
the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because of a 
Reclassification into a lesser or greater number, the Issue 
Date VWAP will be adjusted by multiplying the Issue Date 
VWAP applicable on the Business Day immediately before 
the date of any such Reclassification by the following 
formula:
A
B
where:
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on 
issue immediately before the Reclassification; and
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on 
issue immediately after the Reclassification. 
7.7 
 No adjustment to Issue Date VWAP in 
certain circumstances
Despite the provisions of clauses 7.5 and 7.6, no 
adjustment will be made to the Issue Date VWAP where 
any such adjustment (rounded if applicable) would be less 
than one percent of the Issue Date VWAP then in effect.
For personal use only

7.8 
 Announcement of adjustments to Issue 
Date VWAP
CBA will notify any adjustment to the Issue Date VWAP 
under this clause 7 to ASX and the Holders within 
10 Business Days of CBA determining the adjustment (or 
such shorter period as is required by ASX Listing Rules) 
and the adjustment will be final and binding.
7.9 
Status and listing of Ordinary Shares
(a) Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange will 
rank equally with all other fully paid Ordinary Shares 
provided that the rights attaching to the Ordinary 
Shares issued or arising from Exchange do not take 
effect until 5.00pm (Sydney time) on the Exchange 
Date (or such other time required by APRA).
(b) CBA will use all reasonable endeavours to list the 
Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange of PERLS XII on 
ASX.
(c) Holders acknowledge that any ASX trades in PERLSXII 
that have not settled on the Exchange Date will 
continue to settle in accordance with the normal ASX 
settlement process, although the seller will be treated 
as having delivered and the buyer will be treated as 
having acquired, the number of Ordinary Shares into 
which PERLS XII have been Exchanged. 
7.10 
 Exchange where the Holder does not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an 
Ineligible Holder
If PERLS XII (or percentage of the Face Value of each 
PERLS XII) of a Holder are required to be Exchanged and:
(a) the Holder has notified CBA that it does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares as a result of Exchange, which 
notice may be given at any time on or after the Issue 
Date and prior to the Exchange Date;
(b) the Holder is an Ineligible Holder; or
(c) CBA has not received (for any reason whether or 
not due to the fault of that Holder) any information 
required by it in accordance with the Terms so as to 
impede CBA issuing the Ordinary Shares to a Holder 
on the Exchange Date,
then, on the Exchange Date, the Holders rights 
(including to payment of Distributions) in relation to 
each such PERLS XII being Exchanged are immediately 
and irrevocably terminated and CBA will issue the 
Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a Nominee for 
no additional consideration to hold on trust for sale for 
the benefit of the relevant Holder (unless, because the 
Holder is an Ineligible Holder, the Nominee is deemed 
to be an Ineligible Holder, in which case such issue shall 
occur as soon as practicable after the Nominee ceases 
to be an Ineligible Holder). At the first opportunity to sell 
the Ordinary Shares, the Nominee will arrange for their 
sale and pay the proceeds less selling costs to the relevant 
Holder subject to and in accordance with the provisions of 
the Deed Poll.
If Exchange is occurring because of the occurrence of 
a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
and the Exchange fails to take effect and CBA has not 
otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the Nominee within 
five Business Days after the date of the occurrence of 
the Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then Holders rights will be immediately and irrevocably 
terminated under clause 4.6.
7.11 
Final Distribution 
For the avoidance of doubt, Exchange may occur even 
if CBA, in its absolute discretion, does not make the 
Distribution for the final Distribution Period.
7.12 
 No Exchange after winding up 
commences
If before the Exchange Date an order is made by a court, 
or an effective resolution is passed, for the winding up 
of CBA in Australia, then Exchange will not occur and 
clause 1.5 will apply, except where Exchange is required 
for a Capital Trigger Event or Non-Viability Trigger Event 
(in which case such Exchange shall occur (subject to 
clause 4.6) in accordance with clauses 4.1 or 4.2 (as 
applicable) and clause 4.5).
7.13 
 Exchange of a percentage of Face Value
If under these Terms it is necessary to Exchange a 
percentage of the Face Value, this clause 7 will apply to 
the Exchange as if references to the Face Value were 
references to the relevant percentage of the Face Value to 
be Exchanged.

 Title and transfer of 
PERLSXII
8.1 
Effect of entries in Register
Each entry in the Register of a person as a Holder 
constitutes: 
(a) conclusive evidence of that persons:
(i) absolute ownership of that PERLS XII; 
(ii) entitlement to the other benefits given to Holders 
under these Terms and the Deed Poll in respect of 
PERLS XII; and
(b) an undertaking by CBA to pay Distributions and any 
other amount in accordance with these Terms,
subject to correction of the Register for fraud or error.
8.2 
Non-recognition of interests
Except as required by law, CBA and the Registry must 
treat the person whose name is entered in the Register 
as a Holder as the absolute owner of that PERLS XII. This 
clause applies despite any notice of ownership, trust or 
interest in that PERLS XII. No recognition of any trust, 
encumbrance or interest shall be entered on the Register.
8.3 
Joint holders
Where two or more persons are entered in the Register 
as joint Holders, they are taken to hold that PERLS XII as 
joint tenants with rights of survivorship and subject to the 
terms of the Deed Poll but the Registry is not bound to 
register more than three persons as joint Holders of any 
PERLS XII.

(A)  by a proper transfer under any other applicable 
computerised or electronic system recognised 
by the Corporations Act; or
(B)  by any proper or sufficient instrument of

are entered in the Register.
(c) PERLS XII may be transferred in whole but not in part.
(d) CBA must comply with all Applicable Regulations 
and any other relevant obligations imposed on it in 
relation to the transfer of PERLS XII.
(e) CBA must not charge any fee on the transfer of 
PERLSXII.
(f) The Holder is responsible for any stamp duty or other 
similar taxes which are payable in any jurisdiction 
in connection with a transfer, assignment or other 
dealing with PERLS XII.
(g) Upon registration and entry of the transferee in the 
Register, the transferor ceases to be entitled to future 
benefits under these Terms and the Deed Poll in 
respect of the transferred PERLS XII.
(h) Subject to Applicable Regulations, CBA may 
determine that transfers of some or all PERLS XII 
will not be registered during any period reasonably 
specified by it prior to the Exchange Date, 
Redemption Date or Resale Date of such PERLS XII.
8.5 
Refusal to register
CBA may only refuse to register a transfer of PERLS XII if 
permitted by, or if such registration would contravene or is 
forbidden by, Applicable Regulations or the Terms.
If CBA refuses to register a transfer, CBA must give the 
lodging party notice of the refusal and the reasons for 
it within five Business Days after the date on which the 
transfer was delivered to the Registry.
8.6 
Transmission
A person becoming entitled to PERLS XII as a 
consequence of the death, bankruptcy, liquidation or a 
winding-up of a Holder or of a vesting order by a court 
or other body with power to make the order, or a person 
administering the estate of a Holder, may, upon providing 
evidence as to that entitlement or status, and if CBA 
so requires an indemnity in relation to the correctness 
of such evidence, as CBA considers sufficient, become 
registered as the Holder of those PERLS XII.
9 
Payments
9.1 
Payments to registered Holder
(a) Payment of Distributions will be made to the person 
registered at 7.00pm on the Record Date as the 
Holder.
(b) Payment of any other amount in accordance with 
these Terms will be made to the person registered as 
the Holder on the relevant date for payment.
(c) A payment to any one of joint Holders will discharge 
CBAs liability in respect of the payment.
9.2 
Payments subject to law
All payments are subject to applicable law.
9.3 
Payments on Business Days
If any payment:
(a) is due on a day which is not a Business Day, then the 
due date for payment will be the next Business Day; or
(b) is to be made to an account on a Business Day 
on which banks are not open for general banking 
business in the place in which the account is located, 
then the due date for payment will be the next day on 
which banks are open for general banking business in 
that place. 
No additional amount is payable in respect of any delay 
in payment. Nothing in this clause 9.3 applies to any 
payment referred to in clause 7.1(b).
9.4 
Payments to accounts
Monies payable by CBA to a Holder may be paid by 
crediting an Australian dollar bank account maintained 
in Australia with a financial institution and nominated in 
writing by the Holder by close of business on the relevant 
Record Date or in any other manner CBA decides. 
9.5 
Unsuccessful attempts to pay
(a) If the Holder has not notified the Registry of a bank 
account for the purposes of payment under clause9.4 
or the transfer of any amount does not complete 
for any reason (other than an error made by or on 
behalf of CBA), CBA will be treated as having paid the 
amount on the date on which it would otherwise have 
made the payment.
(b) CBA will send a notice to the registered address of 
the Holder advising of the unsuccessful payment 
and the amount of the unsuccessful payment will 
be held on deposit in a non-interest bearing bank 
account maintained by CBA or the Registry until the 
Holder nominates an Australian dollar bank account 
maintained in Australia for crediting with the payment 
(or nominates a new bank account as the case may 
be) or the claim becomes void under clause 12.1. 
(c) No additional amount is payable in respect of any 
delay in payment.
(d) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 9.5 
obliges CBA to make a payment it has not otherwise 
determined to make under clause 2.

9.6 
Withholdings and Deductions
(a) All payments in respect of PERLS XII must be made 
without any withholding or deduction in respect of 
taxes, unless the withholding or deduction is required 
by law or permitted by this clause 9.6. CBA shall pay 
the full amount deducted to the relevant revenue 
authority within the time allowed for such payment 
without incurring penalty under the applicable law and 
shall, if required by any Holder, deliver to that Holder 
the relevant receipt issued by the revenue authority 
without delay after it is received by CBA.
(b) CBA, in its absolute discretion, may withhold or deduct 
payments to a Holder (including, if applicable, any 
other person who beneficially derives Distributions 
under PERLS XII) where it is required to do so under or 
in connection with FATCA, or where it has reasonable 
grounds to suspect that the Holder or a beneficial 
owner of PERLS XII may be subject to FATCA, and may 
deal with such payment and the Holders PERLS XII 
in accordance with FATCA. If any withholding or 
deduction arises under or in connection with FATCA, 
CBA will not be required to pay any further amounts on 
account of such withholding or deduction or otherwise 
reimburse or compensate, or make any payment to, 
a Holder or a beneficial owner of PERLS XII for or in 
respect of any such withholding or deduction.
(c) Each Holder (including, if applicable, any other 
person who beneficially derives Distributions under 
PERLS XII) will, within 10 Business Days of request by 
CBA, supply to CBA such forms, documentation and 
other information relating to its status under FATCA as 
CBA reasonably requests for the purposes of the CBA 
Group's compliance with FATCA.
10 
 Tax File Number 
withholdings
(a) CBA will withhold an amount from payments of 
Distributions on PERLS XII at the highest marginal tax 
rate plus the highest Medicare levy if a Holder has not 
supplied an appropriate tax file number, Australian 
business number or exemption details.
(b) If a Holder supplies exemption details and CBA 
subsequently determines that the relevant exemption 
was not available, CBA may recover the amount that 
should have been deducted from the relevant Holder 
and may deduct that amount from any subsequent 
payment due to that Holder in respect of PERLS XII. 
11 
Substitution of CBA
11.1 
Substitution
CBA may, in connection with a NOHC Event, without the 
consent of Holders and provided that the Substitution 
Conditions are satisfied, by giving notice to ASX and the 
Holders:
(a) substitute for itself a NOHC as the debtor in respect 
of PERLS XII and as the issuer of Ordinary Shares on 
Exchange (Full Successor); or
(b) substitute for itself a NOHC as the issuer of Ordinary 
Shares on Exchange (Partial Successor),
and a reference to the Successor shall be a reference to 
the Full Successor or the Partial Successor, as applicable. 
The notice shall specify the date on which the substitution 
is to take effect (Date of Substitution).
11.2 
Substitution Conditions
The Substitution Conditions are:
(a) in the case of the Full Successor:
(i) the Full Successor or another entity (which is a 
parent entity) subscribes for Ordinary Shares or 
other capital instruments acceptable to APRA in 
such amount as may be necessary, or takes other 
steps acceptable to APRA, to ensure that the 
capital position of the CBA Level 1 Group and CBA 
Level 2 Group will not be adversely affected;
(ii) the Full Successor will expressly assume CBAs 
obligations under these Terms and the Deed Poll 
by entering into a deed poll for the benefit of 
Holders (Successor Deed Poll) under which it 
agrees (among other things):
(A) to comply with the restrictions in clause 2.7 of 
these Terms (with all necessary modifications); 
and
(B) to deliver fully paid ordinary shares in its 
capital under all circumstances when CBA 
would otherwise have been required to deliver 
Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms 
and conditions as set out in these Terms (with 
all necessary modifications); 
(b) in the case of the Partial Successor:
(i) the Partial Successor agrees with effect on and 
from the Date of Substitution, by entering into a 
Successor Deed Poll, to deliver fully paid ordinary 
shares in its capital under all circumstances when 
CBA would otherwise have been required to 
deliver Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms 
and conditions as set out in these Terms (with all 
necessary modifications); and
(ii) the Partial Successor agrees that in all circumstances 
where the Partial Successor delivers fully paid 
ordinary shares in its capital under the Successor 
Deed Poll in clause 11.2(b)(i), the Partial Successor 
or another entity (which is a parent entity) will 
subscribe for Ordinary Shares in such amount as 
may be necessary, or take other steps acceptable to 
APRA, to ensure that the capital position of the CBA 
Level 1 Group and CBA Level 2 Group is equivalent 
to the position if the Successor Deed Poll had not 
been entered into and CBA was required to issue 
the Ordinary Shares; and

benchmark interest rate (Market Rate) plus a 
Margin to be determined through a bookbuild, 
with the resulting rate multiplied by (1  Tax Rate))

PERLS XII are Exchanged or Redeemed, subject to 
(a) CBA, in its absolute discretion, making the 
Distribution to PERLS XII holders; (b) the

breach of CBAs capital requirements under 
APRAs prudential standards as they are applied to 
the CBA Level 1 Group or the CBA Level 2 Group 
or both at the time of payment; (c) the payment of 
the Distribution not resulting in CBA becoming, 
or being likely to become, Insolvent; and (d) APRA

not accrue and will not be subsequently paid. 
No Distribution will be paid on Exchange where 
Exchange occurs due to a Capital Trigger Event or

CBAs dividend policy in respect of its Ordinary 
Shares is unchanged. However, if distributions of 
PERLS XII are not paid on the relevant 
Distribution

a 
Distribution is paid in full on a subsequent 
Distribution Payment Date (or all PERLS XII are

(or returning capital on or undertaking buy-backs 
of) Ordinary Shares, subject to certain limited 
expectations.

Dear Securityholder
COMMBANK PERLS XII CAPITAL NOTES OFFER
I am writing to let you know that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has launched an offer of a new security, 
CommBank PERLS XII Capital Notes (PERLS XII).   
The offer of PERLS XII will be made under the Prospectus lodged with ASIC on 17 October 2019 (Prospectus). Some of 
the key features of PERLS XII are set out below, but you should consider the Prospectus in full before deciding whether to 
invest in PERLS XII. Please refer to the details contained in this letter on how to obtain a Prospectus and Application Form.
Key Features of PERLS XII
PERLS XII
 
Subordinated unsecured notes issued by CBA with an initial face value of A$100 each.
 
The PERLS XII Terms are complex and include features to comply with the detailed regulatory capital 
requirements which APRA applies to these types of securities.
Distributions
 
Each PERLS XII is scheduled to pay floating rate Distributions quarterly until that PERLS XII is Redeemed 
or Exchanged. Distributions are paid in arrears.
 
Distributions are discretionary and subject to the Distribution payment conditions being satisfied. This 
means a Distribution may not be paid  Distributions that are not paid do not accrue and will not be 
subsequently paid.
 
Distributions are expected to be fully franked and will comprise a combination of franking credits and 
cash equal to the sum of:  
(Market Rate + 3.00% p.a.) x (1  Tax Rate)
 
The Market Rate is the primary benchmark interest rate for the Australian money market. It is also 
known as the 3 month Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (BBSW).
Term
 
Perpetual (no maturity date), but may be Redeemed or Exchanged earlier in certain circumstances.
 
If PERLS XII are not Redeemed or Exchanged (e.g. because the Mandatory Exchange Conditions are not 
satisfied), they could remain on issue indefinitely.
Call Date
 
CBA may, at its option, Redeem all or some PERLS XII on 20 April 2027, subject to receiving APRAs prior 
written approval.
Mandatory 
Exchange 
 
CBA will Exchange PERLS XII into Ordinary Shares on the Mandatory Exchange Date (20 April 2029) 
subject to the Maximum Exchange Number, and the Mandatory Exchange Conditions being satisfied.
 
The Mandatory Exchange Conditions are intended to provide some protection for Holders against 
Exchange occurring when the price of Ordinary Shares has fallen to such a level that you would only 
receive the Maximum Exchange Number.
Early 
Exchange
 
CBA must Exchange PERLS XII before the Mandatory Exchange Date on the occurrence of a Capital 
Trigger Event, a Non-Viability Trigger Event or a Change of Control Event. Information about these 
events, and what will happen to your investment if Exchange is not possible, are described in the 
Prospectus.
Minimum 
Application 
size
 
50 PERLS XII (A$5,000).
 
Applications for more than A$5,000 must be in multiples of 10 PERLS XII (A$1,000).
Tradeable on 
the ASX
 
CBA has made an application to have PERLS XII quoted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). 
Once quoted, PERLS XII are tradeable on ASX at the prevailing market price. PERLS XII are expected to 
be quoted under the trading code CBAPI.

and/or may not be paid Distributions on their PERLS XII. It is important that you read the Prospectus in full before deciding
