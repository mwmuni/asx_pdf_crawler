Dear Martin,

CBA Instalments (CPUIYE series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in Computershare Limited (CPU) with ASX Codes CPUIYE, declared the record 
date for entitlements to the $0.23, 30% franked dividend for the CPU Commonwealth Bank 
Instalments to be 21 August 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 20 August 2019. Again, this coincides

The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of CPU Commonwealth Bank Instalments

September 2019.
