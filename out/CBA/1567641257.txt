Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants

ASX announcement 
APRAs revisions to the related entities 
framework 
 
Tuesday, 20 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today notes the release by Australian 
Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) on revisions to the related entities framework for Authorised Deposit-taking 
institutions (ADIs).  
The reforms include broadening the definition of related entities, a reduction to the limits on exposures to related 
entities and revisions to the Extended Licensed Entities (ELE) framework. The new requirements will be effective from 
1 January 2021. 
APRA confirmed that, among other changes, it will reduce the limits for Australian ADIs exposures to related entities 
from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital.  
As previously disclosed, sufficient capacity exists under the reduced limits to accommodate CBAs exposures to its 
related entities, including the additional capital requirement for New Zealand banks proposed by the RBNZ.  
APRAs announcement is available at www.apra.gov.au.

ASX announcement 
Update on divestment of Australian life 
insurance business 
Friday, 23 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today announced that it has entered 
into further agreements to progress the planned divestment of its Australian life insurance business (CommInsure 
Life) to AIA Group Limited (AIA). 
 
The planned divestment has been subject to ongoing regulatory approval processes, which has led to an extended 
period of uncertainty for CommInsure Life. 
 
The revised transaction path comprises a joint co-operation agreement, reinsurance arrangements, partnership 
milestone payments and a statutory asset transfer. The aggregate proceeds for CBA from the transaction are 
expected to be $2,375m,1 a reduction of $150m from the original sale price. These arrangements are expected to be 
implemented in a staged manner throughout FY20, with CBA to receive approximately $750 million of proceeds and 
distributions by the end of 1H FY20 and the remaining $1,625 million by the end of FY20. 
 
CBA and ASB have also agreed to grant AIA an option to extend the respective Australian and New Zealand 
distribution agreements from 20 years to 25 years.  
 
CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said: Todays announcement provides CommInsure Lifes policyholders 
and staff with more clarity about the future of the business and progresses the simplification of CBAs portfolio of 
businesses. 
 
We are excited by the opportunity to bring together the strengths of AIA and CommInsure Life and are working hard 
with our partner to develop a new generation of products for CBAs customers, which will deliver excellent customer 
outcomes. 
 
The revised transaction path is subject to a number of Australian regulatory approvals, the entry into reinsurance 
arrangements and life insurance entity board approvals. 
 
Details of the revised transaction path 
The revised transaction path comprises the following key components: 
Joint co-operation agreement 
 
CBA and AIA will enter into a joint co-operation agreement, which once implemented, will result in the full 
economic interests associated with CommInsure Life (excluding in relation to the Groups 37.5% equity interest 
in BoCommLife Insurance Company Limited (BoCommLife)) being transferred to AIA and AIA obtaining an 
appropriate level of direct management and oversight of the business. AIA Australia & New Zealand CEO 
Damien Mu will lead CommInsure Life under these arrangements.  
 
Implementation of the joint co-operation agreement is expected before the end of 1H FY20 (Implementation 
Date), at which time CBA will receive an upfront payment of $500 million. 
                                            
1 Subject to completion adjustments.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 152/2019 
 
Reinsurance 
 
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (CMLA), the key life insurance entity of CommInsure Life, 
intends to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with a leading global reinsurer.  
 
The reinsurance arrangement would come into effect on the Implementation Date and is expected to result in 
CBA receiving a distribution from CMLA of approximately $200 million shortly following the Implementation 
Date. 
Partnership milestones  
 
CBA will receive four partnership milestone payments of $50 million each ($200 million in aggregate), to reflect 
the progress in the partnership, with the first payment expected to be received in late 1H FY20. 
Completion 
 
In parallel with the planned share sale of CommInsure Life (which remains subject to a foreign regulatory 
approval process), CBA and AIA are progressing a potential statutory asset transfer as an alternative approach 
to completing the divestment of the business. If implemented, the statutory asset transfer would be expected to 
take approximately 9 months to implement. 
 
Upon completion, whether achieved through a share sale or statutory asset transfer, CBA will receive a final 
payment from AIA of approximately $1,475 million (subject to completion adjustments). 
 
Financial impacts 
Upon completion, which is expected to occur by the end of FY20, the revised transaction path is expected to have 
released approximately $1.6 billion  $1.8 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, resulting in a pro forma 
increase to the Groups CET1 ratio of approximately 35  40 basis points on an APRA basis as at 30 June 2019. 
 
Sale of equity interest in BoCommLife 
CBA remains committed to completing the sale of the Groups 37.5% equity interest in BoCommLife to MS&AD 
Insurance Group Holdings. Completion of the sale of the BoCommLife equity interest remains subject to regulatory 
approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and CBA is working constructively 
with CBIRC in relation to the process. For the avoidance of doubt, the revised transaction path in relation to 
CommInsure Life does not impact this sale process and CBA will continue to exercise full control over the 
BoCommLife equity interest until its sale has been completed.

Dear Martin, 
 
For dissemination to the market: 
 
CBA Instalments (WESIYE series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in Wesfarmers Limited (WES) with ASX Codes WESIYE, declared the record 
date for entitlements to the $0.78, 100% franked dividend for the WES Commonwealth Bank 
Instalments to be 2 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 30 August 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the WES ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of WES Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from WES on 9 October 
2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.wesfarmers.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual 
circumstances.  
 
Should you have any queries, please contact your financial adviser or call CommSec on 13 15 20 
(8am to 5pm AEDT, Monday to Friday). 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
Equity Products Group

over ordinary shares in ASX Limited (ASX) with ASX Codes ASXIYF, declared the record date for 
entitlements to the $1.143, 100% franked dividend for the ASX Commonwealth Bank Instalments to 
be 6 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 5 September 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the ASX ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of ASX Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from ASX on 25 
September 2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.asx.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual circumstances.
