Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants

ASX announcement 
APRAs revisions to the related entities 
framework 
 
Tuesday, 20 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today notes the release by Australian 
Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) on revisions to the related entities framework for Authorised Deposit-taking 
institutions (ADIs).  
The reforms include broadening the definition of related entities, a reduction to the limits on exposures to related 
entities and revisions to the Extended Licensed Entities (ELE) framework. The new requirements will be effective from 
1 January 2021. 
APRA confirmed that, among other changes, it will reduce the limits for Australian ADIs exposures to related entities 
from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital.  
As previously disclosed, sufficient capacity exists under the reduced limits to accommodate CBAs exposures to its 
related entities, including the additional capital requirement for New Zealand banks proposed by the RBNZ.  
APRAs announcement is available at www.apra.gov.au.

ASX announcement 
Update on divestment of Australian life 
insurance business 
Friday, 23 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today announced that it has entered 
into further agreements to progress the planned divestment of its Australian life insurance business (CommInsure 
Life) to AIA Group Limited (AIA). 
 
The planned divestment has been subject to ongoing regulatory approval processes, which has led to an extended 
period of uncertainty for CommInsure Life. 
 
The revised transaction path comprises a joint co-operation agreement, reinsurance arrangements, partnership 
milestone payments and a statutory asset transfer. The aggregate proceeds for CBA from the transaction are 
expected to be $2,375m,1 a reduction of $150m from the original sale price. These arrangements are expected to be 
implemented in a staged manner throughout FY20, with CBA to receive approximately $750 million of proceeds and 
distributions by the end of 1H FY20 and the remaining $1,625 million by the end of FY20. 
 
CBA and ASB have also agreed to grant AIA an option to extend the respective Australian and New Zealand 
distribution agreements from 20 years to 25 years.  
 
CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said: Todays announcement provides CommInsure Lifes policyholders 
and staff with more clarity about the future of the business and progresses the simplification of CBAs portfolio of 
businesses. 
 
We are excited by the opportunity to bring together the strengths of AIA and CommInsure Life and are working hard 
with our partner to develop a new generation of products for CBAs customers, which will deliver excellent customer 
outcomes. 
 
The revised transaction path is subject to a number of Australian regulatory approvals, the entry into reinsurance 
arrangements and life insurance entity board approvals. 
 
Details of the revised transaction path 
The revised transaction path comprises the following key components: 
Joint co-operation agreement 
 
CBA and AIA will enter into a joint co-operation agreement, which once implemented, will result in the full 
economic interests associated with CommInsure Life (excluding in relation to the Groups 37.5% equity interest 
in BoCommLife Insurance Company Limited (BoCommLife)) being transferred to AIA and AIA obtaining an 
appropriate level of direct management and oversight of the business. AIA Australia & New Zealand CEO 
Damien Mu will lead CommInsure Life under these arrangements.  
 
Implementation of the joint co-operation agreement is expected before the end of 1H FY20 (Implementation 
Date), at which time CBA will receive an upfront payment of $500 million. 
                                            
1 Subject to completion adjustments.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 152/2019 
 
Reinsurance 
 
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (CMLA), the key life insurance entity of CommInsure Life, 
intends to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with a leading global reinsurer.  
 
The reinsurance arrangement would come into effect on the Implementation Date and is expected to result in 
CBA receiving a distribution from CMLA of approximately $200 million shortly following the Implementation 
Date. 
Partnership milestones  
 
CBA will receive four partnership milestone payments of $50 million each ($200 million in aggregate), to reflect 
the progress in the partnership, with the first payment expected to be received in late 1H FY20. 
Completion 
 
In parallel with the planned share sale of CommInsure Life (which remains subject to a foreign regulatory 
approval process), CBA and AIA are progressing a potential statutory asset transfer as an alternative approach 
to completing the divestment of the business. If implemented, the statutory asset transfer would be expected to 
take approximately 9 months to implement. 
 
Upon completion, whether achieved through a share sale or statutory asset transfer, CBA will receive a final 
payment from AIA of approximately $1,475 million (subject to completion adjustments). 
 
Financial impacts 
Upon completion, which is expected to occur by the end of FY20, the revised transaction path is expected to have 
released approximately $1.6 billion  $1.8 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, resulting in a pro forma 
increase to the Groups CET1 ratio of approximately 35  40 basis points on an APRA basis as at 30 June 2019. 
 
Sale of equity interest in BoCommLife 
CBA remains committed to completing the sale of the Groups 37.5% equity interest in BoCommLife to MS&AD 
Insurance Group Holdings. Completion of the sale of the BoCommLife equity interest remains subject to regulatory 
approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and CBA is working constructively 
with CBIRC in relation to the process. For the avoidance of doubt, the revised transaction path in relation to 
CommInsure Life does not impact this sale process and CBA will continue to exercise full control over the 
BoCommLife equity interest until its sale has been completed.

Dear Martin, 
 
For dissemination to the market: 
 
CBA Instalments (WESIYE series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in Wesfarmers Limited (WES) with ASX Codes WESIYE, declared the record 
date for entitlements to the $0.78, 100% franked dividend for the WES Commonwealth Bank 
Instalments to be 2 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 30 August 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the WES ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of WES Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from WES on 9 October 
2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.wesfarmers.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual 
circumstances.  
 
Should you have any queries, please contact your financial adviser or call CommSec on 13 15 20 
(8am to 5pm AEDT, Monday to Friday). 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
Equity Products Group

be 6 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 5 September 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the ASX ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of ASX Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from ASX on 25 
September 2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.asx.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual circumstances.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to invite you to attend the 
2019 AGM of the Commonwealth Bank 
ofAustralia. 
In the 2019 financial year we have 
made significant progress on our 
strategy to become a simpler, better 
bank and have been addressing key 
governance, accountability, risk and 
remediationissues.
Becoming a simpler, better bank
We are becoming a simpler, more focused 
bank that is aligned to meeting the needs 
of customers in our core markets. This 
year our focus has been on our Wealth 
Management division where we have  
been remediating past issues and  
making progress on our plans to exit  
our wealthbusinesses. 
We sold our New Zealand life insurance 
business, Sovereign, in July 2018 for 
$1.3billion; and in August this year, 
completed the sale of our global asset 
management business, Colonial First  
State Global Asset Management 
(CFSGAM), for $4.2 billion.
We are making progress on the sales of 
our life insurance businesses in Australia, 
China and Indonesia. We are also exiting 
our aligned financial advice businesses. 
We expect the sale of Count Financial to 
complete in October, are ceasing our  
CFP-Pathways business, and have 
commenced the assisted closure of 
Financial Wisdom. By simplifying our 
portfolio of businesses we are reducing 
risk and cost and creating the capacity 
toinvest in our corebankingbusinesses.
We have also been working to become 
a better bank, and to deliver better 
outcomes for our customers. This year, we 
have been committed to fixing past failings 
and to compensating impacted customers 
quickly. To deliver on our purpose of 
improving customers financial wellbeing 
we have been removing and reducing 
fees and charges, and have introduced 
smart alerts to help customers avoid fees. 
Improvements have also been made to the 
way we listen and respond to customers, 
including the implementation of a more 
robust complaints handling process. 
Executive leadership
This financial year marks the first full 
year of Matt Comyn as Chief Executive 
Officer of the Bank. Matt has built a new 
experienced leadership team that is 
working to deliver cultural change and the 
Banks strategy. 
Governance, culture and accountability
Much work has been done to strengthen 
governance, culture and accountability 
at the Bank. Most recently, this work has 
been guided by the recommendations 
of last years Australian Prudential 
Regulation Authority (APRA) Prudential 
Inquiry into CBA and we have been 
working systematically to deliver all of the 
milestones in the resulting APRA-endorsed 
Remedial Action Plan. The key focus this 
year has been to improve the governance 
and management of non-financial risk, 
including operational risk and compliance. 
We have implemented the Banking 
Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR).

For personal use only
We have also been making changes 
to our business in response to the 
recommendations of the Final Report of 
the Royal Commission into Misconduct in 
the Banking, Superannuation and Financial 
Services Industry. As the supporting 
legislative and regulatory changes are 
made, we will continue to work with our 
regulators and government to implement 
the recommendations. 
Remuneration
Remuneration plays an important role 
in reinforcing the achievement of the 
Banks priorities. Over the past three 
years, remuneration consequences 
and changes to our performance and 
remuneration framework reflect a strong 
focus on reinforcing greater accountability, 
to support cultural change and better 
customer and risk outcomes across  
the Bank.
Over the 2017 and 2018 financial years 
there was a reduction of more than  
$100 million in remuneration outcomes 
for Directors, Executives, senior leaders 
and employees. These consequences 
were applied to reinforce individual and 
collective accountability for the reputation 
of the Bank, the findings of the APRA 
Prudential Inquiry, and poor customer and 
risk outcomes.
This financial year we have continued 
to add more rigour and challenge to 
the risk assessment process which is 
a key consideration when determining 
remuneration outcomes. Of the 15 
Executives eligible for a short-term 
variable remuneration award, 14 received 
in-year reductions in relation to risk and 
reputational matters, including the CEO.
All Group Executives also experienced a 
reduction in their variable remuneration 
outcomes due to shareholder and 
customer outcomes, including as a 
consequence of the impact of customer 
remediation provisions on this years 
financial performance.
Sustainable business practice
We are committed to acting sustainably 
and responsibly in the long-term interests 
of the economy and broader community.
This year we have integrated our 
environmental and social commitments 
into a single Group Environmental and 
Social Policy. This policy includes our 
commitment to supporting the responsible 
global transition to net zero emissions 
 including by reducing our exposures 
to thermal coal mining and coal fired 
power generation, with a view to exiting 
the sectors by 2030, subject to Australia 
having a secure energy platform. The 
policy also incorporates our human 
rights commitments and our approach to 
managing the risks of modern slavery in 
our business operations and supply chains.
Financial performance
In the 2019 financial year, the Bank 
reported a net profit after tax of 
$8,571million on a statutory basis and 
$8,492million on a cash basis.1 
While this years result has been impacted 
by the actions we have taken to deliver 
better customer and risk outcomes 
 including customer remediation 
costs, revenue forgone for the benefit 
of customers, and elevated risk and 
compliance costs  it also reflects the 
continued performance and strength of 
our underlying business. The strength of 
our balance sheet was particularly evident 
this year. As at 30 June 2019, our Common 
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 10.7%, 
above APRAs unquestionably strong 
benchmark of 10.5%. The sale of CFSGAM 
in August has since delivered a further 
68basis points of CET1. 
This performance has enabled the  
Board to declare a final dividend of 
$2.31per share, taking the full year 
dividend to $4.31per share fully franked, 
flat on last year. The final dividend is 
payable on 26 September 2019.
Board renewal
In January, we welcomed Professor 
Genevieve Bell and Paul OMalley to 
the Board. Both will stand for election 
at this AGM with the support of the 
Board. Current Non-Executive Directors, 
MaryPadbury and Shirish Apte, will stand 
for re-election, again with the support of 
the Board. 
Sir David Higgins will retire from the Board 
on 31 December 2019, after more than five 
years of service. I would like to thank Sir 
David for his commitment and contribution. 
Paul will succeed Sir David as Chairman 
of the People & Remuneration Committee 
from 1 January 2020.
Items of business 
The Notice of Meeting for the AGM 
commences on page 8 of this document 
and outlines the items of business that we 
will put to shareholders for consideration. 
Background information on these 
items is contained in the Explanatory 
Memorandum on pages 10 to 15, which

ITEM 3
Adoption of the 2019 Remuneration 
Report
Section 250R of the Corporations Act 2001 
(Cth) (Act) requires a listed company to 
put a resolution to shareholders to adopt 
its Remuneration Report for the relevant 
financial year. 
The Companys Remuneration Report for 
the financial year ended 30 June 2019 can 
be found at pages 82 to 108 of the 2019 
Annual Report. It sets out the performance 
and remuneration for the Companys 
KMP (who comprise the Companys 
Non-Executive Directors, the Managing 
Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
Group Executives, the CEO ASB and 
OtherExecutives1).
The Companys remuneration framework 
is designed to align executive and 
shareholder interests, retain talent and 
support long term value creation by 
providing employees with competitive 
remuneration and rewards for sustainable 
long term performance. The Board 
obtains independent advice on the 
appropriateness of these arrangements. 
The Board also recognises the pivotal role 
that remuneration can play in managing 
risk, contributing to the achievement of 
positive risk management, and outcomes 
to support the Groups consequence 
management framework. The Board 
places a high importance on accountability, 
with remuneration consequences being 
applied when risk and conduct standards 
are not met. 
During the 2019 financial year, a number 
of changes were implemented in order 
to strengthen the link between risk 
management and remuneration outcomes, 
including:
 An Exceptionally Managed category 
being added to the risk assessment 
scale, to ensure the risk assessment 
process promotes and recognises 
effective risk behaviours, supporting 
positive cultural change.
 Introduction of concurrent Board 
Committee meetings during which 
material financial and non-financial 
risks relevant to executive performance 
and remuneration are collectively 
considered across all Committees.
 Updated remuneration mix for the 
Group Chief Risk Officer to now differ 
from other Group Executives and 
further support his independent status 
from the Groups business activities 
The vote on this Item is advisory only 
and does not bind the Directors or 
theCompany. 
The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote in favour of this Item.
ITEM 4
Grant of Securities to Matt Comyn 
ASX Listing Rule 10.14 requires shareholder 
approval for the acquisition of securities 
by a director under an employee incentive 
scheme. Securities include shares and 
rights to acquire shares. While it is currently 
intended that shares will be acquired 
on market as opposed to issuing new 
shares to satisfy any award that vests, 
shareholder approval is being sought, 
both for good governance and to preserve 
flexibility in case, for any reason, it is 
ultimately considered in the Companys 
best interests to issue shares rather than 
source them on market. 
Approval is sought to grant Matt Comyn, 
the Companys Managing Director and 
CEO, rights under the Companys EEP 
as his long-term variable remuneration 
(LTVR) award. LTVR forms part of the 
Companys remuneration strategy 
for the CEO, with market competitive 
remuneration at risk and in alignment with 
shareholder interests. 
It is proposed that a maximum of 47,957 
rights will be granted to Matt Comyn. 
The rights entitle Matt Comyn to receive 
shares, or a cash equivalent payment, 
as determined by the Board, subject to 
vesting conditions, including satisfaction  
of the performance hurdles set out  
below over the period from 1 July 2019 to 
30 June 2023 (the Performance Period). 
The LTVR award aims to focus efforts on 
achieving superior performance for the 
Companys key stakeholder groups, being 
its customers, community, employees and 
shareholders. Participants in the LTVR 
award for the financial year ending 30 
June 2020 comprise Matt Comyn and the 
Companys Group Executives. The CEO 
ASB will also participate in the LTVR award 
for the financial year ending 30 June 2020 
with performance measures relevant to 
the ASB business. Details will be provided 
in the 2020 Annual Report. No other 
Directors are entitled to participate in the 
LTVR award. 
Further details about the rights to be 
offered to Matt Comyn, and the applicable 
performance measures for the LTVR 
award, are set out below.
LTVR award
Matt Comyns 2020 financial year LTVR 
award will be determined according to 
three performance measures:
1. Total Shareholder Returns: 75% of the 
award, a maximum number of 35,969 
rights, will be subject to a performance 
measure that ranks the Companys 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
relative to a peer group comprising 
the 20 largest companies by market 
capitalisation listed on the ASX on 1 July 
2019, excluding resources companies 
and CBA. 
 
The TSR peer group comprises Amcor 
Limited, Aristocrat Leisure Limited, ASX 
Limited, Australia and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited, Brambles 
Limited, Coles Group Limited, CSL 
Limited, Goodman Group, Insurance 
Australia Group Limited, Macquarie 
Group Limited, National Australia 
Bank Limited, QBE Insurance Group 
Limited, Scentre Group, Suncorp 
Group Limited, Sydney Airport, Telstra 
Corporation Limited, Transurban Group, 
Wesfarmers Limited, Westpac Banking 
Corporation, and Woolworths Group 
Limited.
2. Trust and Reputation: 12.5% of the 
award, a maximum number of 5,994 
rights, will be measured against 
the RepTrak Pulse Score Survey 
conducted by the Reputation Institute, 
which uses four equally weighted 
questions to test the trust, respect 
and admiration a respondent has for 
a particular company. The Companys 
score over the Performance Period is 
compared with, and ranked against, 
the performance over the same period 
of a peer group of 16 of the largest 
consumer-facing companies listed 
on the ASX by market capitalisation.

Other Executives include Michael Venter (Chief Operating Officer Wealth Management) and all Acting Group Executives.

Explanatory 
Memorandum
For personal use only
The peer group excludes resource 
companies, companies that are 
not familiar to the general public, 
companies that do not operate 
nationally, and CBA. A positive TSR 
gateway must be achieved before 
any rights subject to this performance 
measure can vest to ensure that no 
vesting occurs unless the change  
in shareholder value over the period 
ispositive.
 
The peer group comprises AGL Energy 
Limited, Australia and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited, Coles Group 
Limited, Crown Resorts Limited, 
Insurance Australia Group Limited, 
Macquarie Group Limited, Medibank 
Private Limited, National Australia Bank 
Limited, Qantas Airways Limited, QBE 
Insurance Group Limited, Stockland 
Corporation Ltd, Suncorp Group 
Limited, Telstra Corporation Limited, 
Wesfarmers Limited, Westpac Banking 
Corporation, and Woolworths Group 
Limited.
3. Employee Engagement: 12.5% of the 
award, a maximum number of 5,994 
rights, will be measured against an 
Employee Engagement performance 
measure. Employees are invited to 
participate in an externally conducted 
survey. Employee Engagement is 
based on the proportion of employees 
responding that they strongly 
agree or agree with four questions 
relating to satisfaction, commitment, 
advocacy and pride (each of which 
is equally weighted). Employee 
Engagement will be measured based 
on the improvement of the Companys 
Employee Engagement outcomes 
over the Performance Period. The 
surveys will be conducted by an 
independent provider who will facilitate 
and collate the results. A positive TSR 
gateway must be achieved before 
any rights subject to this performance 
measure can vest to ensure that no 
vesting occurs unless the change in 
shareholder value over the period is 
positive.
In addition, the LTVR award will be subject to a risk and reputation review by the Board 
before any vesting occurs. This ensures that the outcomes that would otherwise be 
delivered based on performance against the performance measures appropriately 
considers the Banks risk and reputation outcomes.
The number of rights that vest for each performance hurdle will be determined as set  
out below:

For personal use only
The Board may change the peer group 
companies listed above, for example, if  
one of the peer group companies 
ceases to be listed on the ASX during the 
performance period. The next largest ASX 
listed companies by market capitalisation 
at the being of the performance period 
provides the reserve bench. 
How many rights will be granted  
to Matt Comyn?
A maximum of 47,957 rights will be granted 
to Matt Comyn. This number has been 
determined by dividing his maximum 
LTVR opportunity for each tranche by the 
volume weighted average price (VWAP) 
of the Companys ordinary shares over the 
five trading days up to 1 July 2019 (being 
$82.57)). 
If the Company makes a bonus issue or 
rights issue or undertakes a corporate 
action or capital reconstruction, the Board 
may adjust the number or value of the 
rights granted to Matt Comyn to ensure 
no material advantage or disadvantage 
occurs, subject to any ASX Listing Rule 
requirements. Any such adjustments will 
be explained in the Companys Annual 
Report issued following the adjustment. 
Each of the LTVR performance measures 
will be tested following the end of the 
Performance Period (i.e. after year ending 
30 June 2023). The total number of rights 
(if any) that vest will be the aggregate of the 
rights that vest against each performance 
measure, subject to the discretion retained 
by the Board. 
The total award is subject to a risk and 
reputation review. The Board retains 
discretion to determine the amount and 
form of any award that may vest (if any). 
The Board has discretion to determine 
that some or all of the award will lapse in 
certain circumstances, including where,  
in the opinion of the Board:
 
the vesting of rights is not justified or 
supportable having regard to Matt 
Comyns performance and/or conduct 
or the performance of the Company  
as a whole; or
 
the vesting of rights will impact on the 
financial soundness of the Company  
or one of its subsidiaries; or
 
the Company is required or entitled to 
reclaim remuneration or reduce Matt 
Comyns remuneration outcome under 
law, regulation or Company policy; or
 
a significant unexpected or unintended 
consequence or outcome has occurred 
which impacts the Company.
When will the rights be granted?
The rights will be granted to Matt Comyn 
following the 2019 AGM, and in any event 
no later than 12 months after the AGM. 
Is Matt Comyn required to pay for 
therights?
The rights will be granted to Matt Comyn  
at no cost. Matt Comyn will not be 
provided with any loans in relation to his 
acquisition of securities under the EEP.
Is Matt Comyn entitled to dividends?
Prior to vesting, rights do not carry any 
voting or dividend (or equivalent payment) 
rights. Any shares allocated to Matt Comyn 
on vesting of the rights will carry the same 
rights (including with respect to voting and 
dividends) as other ordinary shares in  
the Company. This means that Matt Comyn 
will only receive dividends that are paid 
from the time any rights vest as shares. 
Treatment of shares and rights  
if Matt Comyn leaves the Company
In general, if Matt Comyn ceases 
employment before the rights vest, unless 
the Board determines otherwise, his 
unvested rights will remain on foot and the 
vesting conditions will be tested in  
the ordinary course following the end of 
the Performance Period . In the case  
of termination of employment for cause, 
unless the Board determines otherwise, 
the unvested rights will lapse.
Any rights granted under this award that 
do not vest when tested following the end 
of the Performance Period will lapse.
Participation under previous approvals
At the 2018 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders approved the granting to 
Matt Comyn of rights under the EEP. Matt 
Comyn was subsequently granted 54,364 
rights which are subject to the terms of the 
2019 financial year LTVR award. No price  
is or was payable for the acquisition of 
those rights. No other rights have been 
granted to a Director under the EEP or any 
other employee incentive scheme, since 
the 2018 Annual General Meeting. 
If approval is given under ASX Listing Rule 
10.14, approval is not required under ASX 
Listing Rule 7.1.
The Board (with Matt Comyn abstaining) 
recommends that shareholders vote  
in favour of this Item.
ITEM 5
Adoption of a new Constitution
The Companys current Constitution 
was last amended at the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting. It is proposed to adopt 
a new Constitution as there have been a 
number of developments in law, corporate 
governance principles and general 
corporate and commercial practice for 
ASX listed companies since that time.
The Board recommends the adoption of 
a new Constitution which reflects current 
market practice and terminology. Many of 
the proposed changes are administrative 
or relatively minor in nature. The material 
differences between the current 
Constitution and the new Constitution 
areoutlined below.
Share capital and variation of 
classrights
The preference share provisions in rule 
2.2 of the new Constitution are less 
prescriptive than the equivalent provisions 
under the current Constitution, conferring 
greater flexibility regarding the terms of 
any preference shares issued in the future. 
Proposed rule 2.5(b) of the new 
Constitution sets out the rules relating 
to separate class meetings such that 
a quorum is at least 2 persons holding 
or representing at least one third of the 
issued shares of the class or, if there is one 
holder of shares in a class, that person. 
Any holder of shares of the class present, 
or the chair of the meeting, may demand 
a poll. 
Calls, forfeiture, indemnities, 
lienandsurrender
Currently, the Company has a default fixed 
interest rate of 15% p.a. (or such other 
rate as the Directors may determine) in 
respect of amounts which may be owed 
by shareholders. Under rule 3.9 of the 
new Constitution, this default fixed rate 
would be replaced by a floating interest 
rate based on the penalty interest rate 
set under legislation (or if the Board has 
fixed a rate, that rate). Proposed rules 3.4, 
3.5 and 3.6 also clarify the ability of the 
Board to exempt shares from forfeiture, 
lien and the members indemnity under 
the Constitution (should circumstances 
warrant it).

Explanatory 
Memorandum
For personal use only
Dividends 
The Companys current Constitution 
has separate provisions for interim and 
final dividends and adopts a range of 
terminology to describe how the Company 
pays dividends. Rule 4.1 of the new 
Constitution harmonises these provisions 
and adopts the generic term dividend to 
avoid any potential technical distinctions 
interminology.
Proposed rule 4.1 also introduces scope 
for the Company to reinvest unclaimed 
dividends, for the benefit of the relevant 
shareholder, into shares in the Company 
after a period of time has elapsed. The 
existing equivalent rule in the Companys 
current Constitution provides that 
unclaimed money can be used for the 
benefit of the Company until such time as 
it is claimed or disposed of in accordance 
with the law.
Transfer and transmission of shares
The Companys current constitutional 
provisions regarding unmarketable parcels 
of shares impose time limitations which are 
not required under the ASX Listing Rules. 
These restrictions are removed in the new 
Constitution which more closely reflects 
the requirements of the ASX Listing Rules. 
New rule 5.4 clarifies that the Board may, 
in certain circumstances, revoke a notice 
given in relation to an unmarketableparcel.
General meetings
The new Constitution incorporates a 
number of changes to assist with the 
orderly conduct of general meetings of 
theCompany.
Rule 6.6 of the new Constitution expressly 
confirms the Chairmans power to not 
put certain resolutions to the meeting, 
notwithstanding they may have been listed 
in the notice of meeting. 
New rule 6.7 provides that a matter will be 
decided on a poll without first being put  
to the meeting on a show of hands where 
the matter is set out in the notice of 
meeting or any other circumstance where 
the Chairman determines it appropriate. 
Directors
The Companys current Constitution 
requires one third of the Board to stand 
for election at each AGM. The new 
Constitution will remove this rule to bring 
the Companys Constitution in line with 
the ASX Listing Rules, which require 
an election of Directors each year and 
that a Director must not hold office 
(without re-election) past the third annual 
general meeting following the Directors 
appointment or three years, whichever 
islonger.
The rules in the new Constitution 
relating to Directors remuneration 
are broadly in line with the rules in the 
current Constitution. Rule 7.3 of the new 
Constitution clarifies that in calculating 
the maximum fees payable to Directors, 
superannuation contributions made to 
comply with superannuation guarantee 
legislation are included in the aggregate 
fee cap.
The current Constitution provides that 
the quorum for a Directors meeting is 
one half of the total number of Directors 
for the time being in office (rounded 
upwards if not a whole number), or three, 
whichever is greater. The new Constitution 
provides that unless the Board decides 
differently, the quorum is one half of the 
total number of Directors for the time 
being in office who are not excluded 
(rounded upwards if not a whole number) 
or three, whichever is greater. A Director 
will be excluded where (i) they are on a 
leave of absence approved by the Board, 
(ii) they have notified the Chairman or the 
Group Company Secretary they may be 
uncontactable for a certain period of time 
and the Board meeting is held during that 
period, (iii) they are incapacitated (e.g. 
due to ill health), (iv) they have disqualified 
themselves from considering the relevant 
item(s) of business at a Board meeting, or 
(v) they would be prohibited under the Act 
or other laws or regulations from voting on 
the relevant item(s) of business.
Directors can pass written resolutions 
of the Board where (i) all Directors (other 
than those excluded as outlined below) 
sign or consent to the resolution, and 
(ii) the Directors who sign or consent to 
the resolution would have constituted a 
quorum at the meeting.
Directors will be excluded where (i) they 
are on a leave of absence approved by the 
Board, (ii) they have notified the Chairman 
or the Group Company Secretary they 
may be uncontactable during the period 
the resolution is being considered, (iii) they 
are incapacitated (e.g. due to ill health), 
(iv) they have disqualified themselves 
from considering the resolution or (v) they 
would be prohibited under the Act or other 
laws or regulations from voting on the 
resolution. All Directors are expected to 
attend all Board meetings and participate 
in Board decisions.
Notices
The Companys existing rules regarding 
giving notice to shareholders provide that, 
aside from the notice of meeting, notice 
will be served on the day that it would 
arrive in the ordinary course of the post. 
Rule 13.4 of the new Constitution adopts 
a standard ASX listed company approach 
to members notices and simplifies 
administration by providing that a notice 
from the Company properly addressed 
and posted, is taken to be served at 
10.00am Sydney time on the day after 
thedate it is posted. 
General Updates
Rules which were outdated or restated 
Act or ASX Listing Rule requirements have 
been removed to simplify the document 
and minimise the need for updates in 
the event of any legislative or regulatory 
change. The provisions of the Constitution 
have been amended to reflect changes 
in terminology now contained in the Act, 
the ASX Listing Rules and ASX Settlement 
Operating Rules. 
The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote in favour of this Item.

LODGEMENT OF A VOTING/PROXY FORM
HOW TO COMPLETE THIS VOTING/PROXY FORM
YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS
This is your name and address as it appears on the Companys share register. If 
this information is incorrect, please make the correction on this form. Shareholders 
sponsored by a broker should advise their broker of any changes. Please note: 
you cannot change ownership of your shares using this form.
METHOD A  VOTE DIRECTLY
If you mark the box in METHOD A, you are indicating that you wish to vote directly. 
Please mark either For, Against or Abstain for an Item for your vote to be 
counted on that Item. If you vote on at least one Item but leave other Item(s) blank, 
the vote on the Item(s) marked will be valid but no vote will be counted or treated as 
being cast for the Item(s) left blank. If you mark more than one box on an Item, your 
vote on the Item will be invalid. If no voting instructions are given on all of the Items 
then the Chairman of the Meeting will be deemed to be your appointed proxy.
If you mark the boxes in both METHOD A and METHOD B then METHOD B is 
deemed to be the chosen method. The person named will be your proxy, or if no 
person is named, the Chairman of the Meeting will be your appointed proxy.
If you have lodged a direct vote, and then attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting, your direct vote will be cancelled. Attending the Annual General Meeting 
only will not invalidate your direct vote.
The Chairmans decision as to whether a direct vote is valid is conclusive.
METHOD B  APPOINT A PROXY
If you wish to appoint the Chairman of the Meeting as your proxy, mark the box 
in METHOD B. If you wish to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the 
Meeting as your proxy, please write the name of that person or body corporate in 
the box provided. If you leave this section blank, or your named proxy does not 
attend the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman of the Meeting will be your 
proxy. If your named proxy attends the Annual General Meeting but does not vote 
on a poll on an Item in accordance with your directions, the Chairman of the 
Meeting will become your proxy in respect of that Item. A proxy need not be a 
shareholder of the Company. A proxy may be an individual or a body corporate.
VOTES ON ITEMS OF BUSINESS  PROXY APPOINTMENT
You should direct your proxy how to vote by placing a mark in one of the boxes 
opposite each Item of Business. All your shares will be voted in accordance with 
such a direction, unless you indicate only a portion of voting rights are to be voted 
on any Item by inserting the percentage or number of shares you wish to vote in 
the appropriate box or boxes. If you do not mark any of the boxes on the Items of 
Business, your proxy may vote, or abstain from voting, as he or she chooses. If 
you mark more than one box on an Item, your vote on that Item will be invalid.
APPOINTMENT OF A SECOND PROXY
If you are a shareholder entitled to cast two or more votes, you are entitled to 
appoint up to two persons as proxies to attend the Annual General Meeting and 
vote on a poll. If you wish to appoint a second proxy, an additional Voting/Proxy 
Form may be obtained by telephoning the Companys share registry or you may 
copy this form. 
To appoint a second proxy you must:
(a) on each of the first Voting/Proxy Form and the second Voting/Proxy Form, 
state the percentage of your voting rights or number of shares applicable to 
that form. If the appointments do not specify the percentage or number of 
votes that each proxy may exercise, each proxy may exercise half your votes. 
Fractions of votes will be disregarded; and
(b) return both forms together.
SIGNING INSTRUCTIONS
You must sign this form as follows in the spaces provided:
Individual: where the holding is in one name, the holder must sign.

ASX announcement 
ISSUE OF U.S.$2.5 BILLION WORTH OF 
SUBORDINATED NOTES 
Notice under section 708A(12H)(e) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) 
Thursday, 12 September 2019: Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is pleased to confirm that today it issued 
U.S.$2.5 billion worth of subordinated notes. The U.S.$1.25 billion 3.610 percent subordinated notes due 2034 (2034 
Subordinated Notes) and the U.S.$1.25 billion 3.743 percent subordinated notes due 2039 (2039 Subordinated 
Notes, and together with the 2034 Subordinated Notes, Subordinated Notes) were issued pursuant to CBAs U.S. 
$50,000,000,000 Senior and Subordinated Medium Term Notes Program (U.S. MTN Program). Terms used but not 
defined in this announcement are defined in the offering circular for the issue of the Subordinated Notes under U.S. 
MTN Program dated 23 August 2019 (Offering Circular). 
The Subordinated Notes potentially exchange into fully paid ordinary shares of CBA (Ordinary Shares) if a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs. 
This notice is a cleansing notice prepared for the purposes of section 708A(12H)(e) of the Corporations Act 2001 
(Cth) (Corporations Act) (as inserted by ASIC Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71). 
CBA has elected to give this notice to enable Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange to be sold without disclosure 
under Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act. This notice includes all the information investors and their professional 
advisers would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of: 
 
in Schedule 1A, the rights and liabilities attaching to the 2034 Subordinated Notes that is based on the 
description in the Offering Circular, as supplemented by the pricing supplement for the 2034 Subordinated 
Notes dated 5 September 2019 (2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement);  
 
in Schedule 1B, the rights and liabilities attaching to the 2039 Subordinated Notes that is based on the 
description in the Offering Circular, as supplemented by the pricing supplement for the 2039 Subordinated 
Notes dated 5 September 2019 (2039 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, and together with the 
2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, Pricing Supplement); and  
 
in Schedule 2, the rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares, 
in each case only to the extent to which it is reasonable for investors and their professional advisers to expect to find 
the information in this notice. 
CBA confirms that: 
(a) 
the Subordinated Notes were issued without disclosure to investors under Part 6D.2 of the Corporations Act; 
(b) 
the information in this notice remains current as at todays date; 
(c) 
this notice (including the schedules) complies with section 708A of the Corporations Act, as modified by ASIC 
Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71; and

Effect of the Subordinated Notes offer on CBA 
The issue of Subordinated Notes by CBA will not have a material impact on CBAs financial position. If a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event occurs and CBA issues Ordinary Shares, the impact of Exchange on CBA would be to increase CBAs 
shareholders equity. The number of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange is limited to the Maximum Exchange 
Number. The Maximum Exchange Number is 94.82 Ordinary Shares per Subordinated Note (with a nominal value of 
A$1,475.20), based on the Issue Date VWAP of A$77.79 per Ordinary Share.  
Additional information 
CBA is a disclosing entity for the purposes of the Corporations Act and, as a result, is subject to regular reporting and 
disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act and the ASX Listing Rules. In addition, CBA must notify ASX 
immediately (subject to certain exceptions) if it becomes aware of information about CBA that a reasonable person 
would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of its securities including Ordinary Shares. 
Copies of documents lodged with ASIC can be obtained from, or inspected at, an ASIC office. They can also be 
obtained from www.asx.com.au together with CBAs other ASX announcements.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED NOTES 
The information included in the following sections of this document is based on material in the Offering Circular and the 2034 
Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement. 
The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations and claims in respect of Subordinated Notes will 
rank in our Winding-Up after the claims of all Senior Ranking Obligations, pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking 
Securities and ahead of claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities, as further defined and described below under How the 
Subordinated Notes rank against other debt.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs prior to the maturity date or earlier Subordinated Note Redemption, we must Exchange all 
or some of the Subordinated Notes or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case 
may be and in an amount as determined as described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event below) for Ordinary Shares. A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing 
that it believes (i) an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA 
Group, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable or (ii) a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable. 
If, for any reason, an Exchange fails to take effect and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in 
respect of such Exchange within five Business Days after the occurrence of the applicable Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the 
rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest and 
to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes or the percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down. See Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event for more information. 
If the amount of our Relevant Tier 1 Securities is not sufficient to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable, some or all 
of our Relevant Tier 2 Securities, including the Subordinated Notes, will be subject to Exchange or Write Down. See  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event below.  
A Subordinated Note Redemption may, subject to the terms described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated 
Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances, occur at our option, in whole but not in 
part, following the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events.  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued only in fully registered form in denominations of US$200,000 and integral multiples of 
US$1,000 in excess thereof (the Specified Denomination). 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Fiscal Agency Agreement and its associated 
documents, including the Subordinated Notes and the 2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, contain the full legal text 
of the matters described in this section entitled Description of the Subordinated Notes. This section is a summary only and 
does not describe every aspect of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. For example, in this section and the 
2034 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, we use terms that have been given special meaning in the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement, but we describe the meaning of only the more important of those terms.  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us and the subordination, 
Exchange, Write Down and substitution provisions of the Subordinated Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the law applying in New South Wales, Australia.  
For personal use only

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Copies of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the form of Subordinated Note are available for inspection during normal business 
hours at the office of the Fiscal Agent.  
The Fiscal Agent performs administrative duties for us such as sending interest payments and notices to holders. See  Our 
relationship with the Fiscal Agent below for more information about the Fiscal Agent.  
We may issue other debt securities  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes do not limit our ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other 
securities. Also, we are not subject to financial covenants or similar restrictions by the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt 
Loss absorption does not apply to our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
The requirement for a conversion or write down on account of our non-viability does not apply to an amount of our 
subordinated debt that was issued prior to January 1, 2013. Accordingly, holders of Subordinated Notes are likely to be in a 
worse position in the event we become non-viable than holders of our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
because that subordinated debt generally does not require that it be exchanged or written down upon the occurrence of a Non-
Viability Trigger Event.  
Status of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will not be secured by any of our property or assets. Thus, by owning a Subordinated Note, a holder of 
a Subordinated Noted is an unsecured creditor. The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations 
and will rank pari passu with Equal Ranking Securities.  
The liabilities which are preferred by law to the claim of a holder in respect of the Subordinated Notes are substantial. The terms 
and conditions of the Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of such liabilities which we may incur or assume from time to 
time. 
Each holder should be aware that, if we are in a Winding-Up, it is possible that a Non-Viability Trigger Event will have already 
occurred, following which the holders Subordinated Notes may be, or may have already been, Exchanged for Ordinary Shares or 
Written Down. See  How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt and  Default, remedies and waiver of default 
below for additional information on how subordination limits the ability of holders of Subordinated Notes to receive payment or 
pursue other rights if we default or have certain other financial difficulties.  
Claims in respect of Subordinated Notes rank in our Winding-Up: 
 
after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims preferred by applicable laws;  
 
pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking Securities; and  
 
ahead of all claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims referred to in Sections 563AA and 563A of 
the Corporations Act.  
The applicable laws referred to above include (but are not limited to) Sections 13A and 16 of the Australian Banking Act and 
Section 86 of the Reserve Bank Act. These provisions provide that, in the event that we becomes unable to meet our obligations 
or suspend payment, our assets in Australia are to be available to meet our liabilities to, among others, APRA, the RBA and 
holders of protected accounts held in Australia, in priority to all other liabilities, including the Subordinated Notes.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. The Subordinated Notes do not constitute 
deposit liabilities or protected accounts for us in Australia for the purposes of the Australian Banking Act and are not insured or 
guaranteed by the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any government, governmental agency or 
compensation scheme of the United States, Australia or any other jurisdiction or by any other party.   
In our Winding-Up, payments on each Subordinated Note are subject to: (i) all holders of Senior Ranking Obligations being paid 
in full before any payment is made to holders of Subordinated Notes; and (ii) holders of Subordinated Notes and holders of 
Equal Ranking Securities being paid on a pro-rata basis.  
We expect that from time to time we will incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that will constitute Senior Ranking 
Obligations. The Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of our obligations that can rank ahead of the Subordinated Notes 
that we may incur or assume in the future. 
Equal Ranking Securities means any instrument that ranks in our Winding-Up as the most junior claim in our Winding-Up 
ranking senior to Junior Ranking Securities, and includes: 
 
if on issue at the commencement of our Winding-Up, the JPY20,000,000,000 Perpetual Subordinated Callable 
Fixed/Floating Rate Reverse Dual Currency Securities issued by us in 1999; and 
 
any other instruments, present and future, issued after January 1, 2013 as instruments constituting Tier 2 Capital. 
Junior Ranking Securities means:  
 
any instrument, present and future, issued by us which qualifies as Tier 1 Capital (or, in the case of any instrument 
issued prior to January 1, 2013), was treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in accordance with the prudential standards 
which applied prior to January 1, 2013, irrespective of whether or not such instrument is treated as constituting Tier 1 
Capital in accordance with any transitional arrangements provided by APRA or which rank or are expressed to rank 
equally with such securities in our Winding-Up; and  
 
all of our Ordinary Shares. 
Senior Ranking Obligations means all our present and future deposits and other liabilities, securities and other obligations 
which would be entitled to be admitted in our Winding-Up (and including, but not limited to, obligations in respect of 
instruments issued before January 1, 2013 as Tier 2 Capital) other than Equal Ranking Securities and Junior Ranking Securities.  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of us, any holder of a Subordinated Note or any person claiming 
through us or a holder of a Subordinated Note has any right of set-off in respect of any amounts owed by one person to the 
other person. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement, each holder irrevocably acknowledges and 
agrees that: 
 
the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes are a debt subordination for the purposes of Section 563C of 
the Australian Corporations Act;  
 
the debt subordination is not affected by our act or omission, or any act or omission of any holder of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, which might otherwise affect holders of Subordinated Notes at law or in equity; 
 
it must not exercise its voting rights as an unsecured creditor in our Winding-Up or administration in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes to defeat the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes; and 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
12 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
it must pay or deliver to the liquidator any amount or asset received on account of its claim in the Winding-Up in 
excess of its entitlement under the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes. 
For the avoidance of doubt, but subject as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence 
of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot occur, if a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred, 
holders of Subordinated Notes will rank in our Winding-Up as holders of the number of Ordinary Shares to which they became 
entitled as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
Form of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued in global  i.e., book-entry  form represented by a global security registered in the 
name of a depositary, which will be the holder of all the Subordinated Notes represented by the global security.  
Subordinated Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (Securities Act) will be represented by one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Rule 144A Global Note), 
registered in the name of a nominee of The Depositary Trust Company (DTC). Subordinated Notes sold outside of the United 
States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be represented by 
one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Regulation S Global Note and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the 
Global Notes) registered in the name of a nominee of DTC or a common depositary for DTC (the Depositary).  
Those who own beneficial interests in a Global Note will do so through participants in the Depositarys securities clearance 
system, and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the Depositary and its 
participants.  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  
Non-Viability Trigger Event 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes: 
 
an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA Group, 
is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable; or 
 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-
viable. 
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital instruments which must be Exchanged, Written Down, converted or written 
down (as applicable). 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, we must Exchange in accordance with Exchange and No further rights if Exchange 
cannot occur below such number of Subordinated Notes (or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) as is equal (taking into account any conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities 
as defined below) to the aggregate face value of capital instruments which APRA has notified us must be exchanged, converted 
or written down (or, if APRA has not so notified us, such number or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note as is necessary to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable). If a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable, we must Exchange all Subordinated Notes.

In determining the number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, which must be Exchanged in accordance with this section, we will: 
 
first, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 1 Securities whose terms require or permit, 
or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange of the 
Subordinated Notes; 
 
secondly, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or 
permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange 
of the Subordinated Notes; and  
 
thirdly, if exchange, conversion or write down of those securities is not sufficient, Exchange (in the case of the 
Subordinated Notes) or exchange, convert or write down (in the case of any other Relevant Tier 2 Securities) on a pro-
rata basis or in a manner that is otherwise, in our opinion, fair and reasonable, the Subordinated Notes and any other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be 
exchanged, converted or written down in that manner (subject to such adjustments as we may determine to take into 
account the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares and any Subordinated Notes or other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities remaining on issue),  
but such determination will not impede the immediate Exchange of the relevant number of Subordinated Notes or percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be).  
Relevant Security means a Relevant Tier 1 Security and a Relevant Tier 2 Security. 
Relevant Tier 1 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 1 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
Relevant Tier 2 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 2 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, then: 
 
the relevant number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, must be Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event in accordance with 
Exchange and Exchange Mechanics below and the Exchange will be irrevocable; 
 
we must give notice as soon as practicable that Exchange has occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the 
holders of Subordinated Notes; 
 
the notice must specify the date on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred; and 
 
the notice must specify the details of the Exchange process, including any details which were taken into account in 
relation to the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, and the impact on any 
Subordinated Notes remaining on issue. 
Failure to undertake any of the steps in the paragraph above does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise impede Exchange or 
Write Down, respectively. 
For the purposes of the foregoing, where the specified currency of the face value of Relevant Tier 1 Securities, Relevant Tier 2 
Securities and/or Subordinated Notes (as applicable) is not Australian Dollars, we may treat them as if converted into Australian 
Dollars using the Exchange Date Cross Rate.

Exchange 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be Exchanged at the option of a holder thereof. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred and all or some of the Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are required to be Exchanged in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then: 
 
Exchange of the relevant Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each 
Subordinated Note will occur in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event and Exchange Mechanics 
immediately upon the date of occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event; and 
 
the entry of the corresponding Subordinated Note in each relevant holding of a holder of Subordinated Notes in the 
register of the Depositary will constitute an entitlement of that holder of Subordinated Notes (or, where the provisions 
described under Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, of the nominee) to the relevant number of 
Ordinary Shares (and, if applicable, also to any remaining balance of the Subordinated Notes or remaining percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note), and we will recognize the holder of Subordinated 
Notes (or, where Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, the nominee) as having been issued the 
relevant Ordinary Shares for all purposes, 
in each case without the need for any further act or step by us, the holder of the Subordinated Note or any other person (and 
we will, as soon as possible thereafter and without delay on our part, take any appropriate procedural steps to record such 
Exchange, including to procure the updating of the register of the Depositary and the Ordinary Share register and seek quotation 
of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange). 
In relation to an Exchange, we shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary of the percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note that has been Exchanged and instruct the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary to reflect this 
Exchange in the relevant Global Note or other certificate representing the Subordinated Notes so that the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of such Subordinated Note is reduced by the relevant percentage. In the case of an Exchange of only part of a 
Subordinated Note, upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Note, we will issue a new Subordinated Note in the 
name of the holder with a reduced Outstanding Principal Amount reflecting the Exchange.  
For the avoidance of doubt: 
 
nothing in the Subordinated Notes will allow a payment to be made to a holder of Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; 
and 
 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption issued as 
described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated 
Notes under certain circumstances. 
Exchange means the exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes or a percentage of each Subordinated Note for Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and Exchanged has a corresponding meaning. 
No further rights if Exchange cannot occur 
If for any reason, Exchange of any Subordinated Note or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated 
Note required to be Exchanged described under Non-Viability Trigger Event fails to take effect as described in Exchange 
and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business

Days after the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated 
Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest, and the right to receive Ordinary Shares) in 
relation to such Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately and irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the 
occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event (Written Down). We must give notice as soon as practicable that Write Down has 
occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes, and the notice must specify the date on 
which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred.  
Appointment of Appointed Person 
Each holder of a Subordinated Note, on behalf of itself and (in the case of any Global Note) any person owning an indirect 
interest in such Subordinated Note, irrevocably: 
 
appoints us and our duly authorized officers and any liquidator, administrator, statutory manager or other similar 
official of CBA (each an Appointed Person) severally to be the attorney of the holder and the agents of the holder, 
with the power in the name and on behalf of the holder to: 
 
do all such acts and things (including, without limitation signing all documents, instruments or transfers or 
instructing CHESS) as may, in the opinion of the Appointed Person, be necessary or desirable to be done in 
order to give effect to, record or perfect an Exchange or Write Down (as applicable); 
 
do all other things which an Appointed Person reasonably believes to be necessary or desirable to give effect 
to the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
appoint in turn its own agent or delegate; and 
 
authorizes and directs us and/or the Fiscal Agent to make such entries in the register, including amendments and 
additions to the register, which we and/or the Fiscal Agent may consider necessary or desirable to record an Exchange 
or Write Down (as applicable). 
The power of attorney to be given by Subordinated Note holders in respect of the Subordinated Notes will be given for valuable 
consideration and to secure the performance by the Subordinated Note holder of the Subordinated Note holders obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes, will be irrevocable and will survive and not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity 
of the Subordinated Note holder (or, if such Subordinated Note holder is an entity, by its dissolution or termination). An 
Appointed Person will have no liability in respect of any acts duly performed in accordance with the power of attorney thereby 
given.

Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) required to be Exchanged. The Exchange Number is, subject 
always to the Exchange Number being no greater than the Maximum Exchange Number, calculated according to the

VWAP (expressed in Australian dollars and cents) means the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of 
Ordinary Shares traded on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period, subject to any adjustments made as described under 
 Adjustments to VWAP generally and  Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction, but the trades taken 
into account in determining such daily volume weighted average prices will exclude special crossings, crossings prior to 
the commencement of normal trading or during the closing phase or after hours adjustment phase, overnight

The rights of each holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of interest) in relation to each Subordinated Note that is 
being Exchanged (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note that is being Exchanged) will 
be immediately and irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) and we will apply that amount by way of 
payment for the subscription for the Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued under as described under the paragraph above. 
Each holder of Subordinated Notes is taken to have irrevocably directed that any amount payable under this section is to be 
applied as provided for in this section and no holder of Subordinated Notes has any right to payment in any other way. 
If the total number of additional Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued in respect of the aggregate holding of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes includes a fraction of an Ordinary Share, that fraction of an Ordinary Share will be disregarded. 
Subject to the conditions described in Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, where Subordinated Notes are Exchanged, we will allot 
and issue the Ordinary Shares to the holder of Subordinated Notes on the basis that the name and address set out in the register 
of holders (or, if not set out in the register, otherwise held by the Depositary) are the name and address for entry into any 
register of title and delivery of any certificate or holding statement in respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange. 
Adjustments to VWAP generally 
For the purposes of calculating the VWAP under Exchange above:  
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the relevant VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted on ASX as 
cum dividend or cum any other distribution or entitlement and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary 
Shares after that date and those Ordinary Shares will no longer carry that dividend or any other distribution or 
entitlement, then the VWAP on the Business Days on which those Ordinary Shares have been quoted cum dividend or 
cum any other distribution or entitlement will be reduced by an amount (Cum Value) equal to:  
 
in the case of a cash dividend or other distribution, the amount of that dividend or other distribution;  
 
in the case of any other entitlement that is not a dividend or other distribution under the bullet above which 
is traded on ASX on any of those Business Days, the volume weighted average price of all such entitlements 
sold on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period on the Business Days on which those entitlements were traded 
(excluding trades of the kind that would be excluded in determining VWAP under the definition of that 
term); or 
 
in the case of any other entitlement which is not traded on ASX during the VWAP Period, the value of the 
entitlement as reasonably determined by our Board; and 
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted as ex dividend or 
ex any other distribution or entitlement, and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares which would 
be entitled to receive the relevant dividend, distribution or entitlement, the VWAP on the Business Days on which 
those Ordinary Shares have been quoted ex dividend or ex any other distribution or entitlement will be increased by 
the Cum Value.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction 
Where, during the relevant VWAP Period, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because the Ordinary 
Shares are reconstructed, consolidated, divided or reclassified (not involving any payment or other compensation to or by 
holders of Ordinary Shares) (Reclassification) into a lesser or greater number, the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period 
which falls before the date on which trading in Ordinary Shares is conducted on a post Reclassification basis will be adjusted by 
multiplying the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period by the following formula: 
A 
B 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately after the Reclassification. 
Any adjustment made by us in accordance with the paragraph above will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated 
Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement will be construed 
accordingly. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section allows a cash payment or other distribution to be made to or by a holder of 
Subordinated Notes as part of a Reclassification or as a result of a Reclassification. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP generally 
For the purposes of determining the Issue Date VWAP as described under Exchange, adjustments will be made in 
accordance with Adjustments to VWAP generally and Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction  during the 
VWAP Period for the Issue Date VWAP. On and from the issue date, adjustments to the Issue Date VWAP: 
 
may be made by us in accordance with the conditions described below under Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
bonus issues, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP in certain circumstances (inclusive); 
 
if so made, will correspondingly cause an adjustment to the Maximum Exchange Number; and  
 
if so made, will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be construed accordingly. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues 
Subject to the two paragraphs at the end of this section, if we make a pro-rata bonus issue of Ordinary Shares to holders of 
Ordinary Shares generally, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted immediately in accordance with the following formula: 
V = Vo x RD/(RD + RN) 
where: 
V means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately after the application of this formula; 
Vo means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately prior to the application of this formula; 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
19 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
RD means the number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately prior to the allotment of new Ordinary Shares 
pursuant to the bonus issue; and 
RN means the number of Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the bonus issue. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the paragraph above does not apply to Ordinary Shares issued as part of a bonus share plan, 
employee or executive share plan, executive option plan, share top up plan, share purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment 
plan. 
For the purposes of this section, an issue will be regarded as a bonus issue notwithstanding that we do not make offers to some 
or all holders of Ordinary Shares with registered addresses outside Australia (or to whom an offer is otherwise subject to foreign 
securities laws), provided that in so doing we are not in contravention of the ASX Listing Rules. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction 
If, at any time after the issue date, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because of a Reclassification into 
a lesser or greater number, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted by multiplying the Issue Date VWAP applicable on the Business 
Day immediately before the date of any such Reclassification by the following formula: 
A 
B 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately after the Reclassification. 
No adjustment to Issue Date VWAP in certain circumstances 
Despite the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP for capital reconstruction, no adjustment will be made to the Issue Date VWAP where any such adjustment (rounded if 
applicable) would be less than 1% of the Issue Date VWAP then in effect. 
Announcement of adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
We will notify any adjustment to the Issue Date VWAP under the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
generally, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues  and Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital 
reconstruction to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes within 10 Business Days of us 
determining the adjustment and the adjustment will be final and binding. 
Status and quotation of Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange will rank equally with all other fully paid Ordinary Shares provided that the 
rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange do not take effect until 5:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on the 
Exchange Date (or such other time required by APRA). 
We will use all reasonable endeavours to quote the Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange of the Subordinated Notes on ASX.

Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder 
1. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and: 
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes has notified us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of 
Exchange, which notice may be given at any time on or after the issue date and prior to the Exchange Date;  
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder; or  
 
we have not received (for any reason whether or not due to the fault of that holder of Subordinated Notes) any 
information required by it in accordance with the conditions of the Subordinated Notes so as to impede us issuing the 
Ordinary Shares to a holder of Subordinated Notes on the Exchange Date, 
then, subject to the provisions described in paragraph 2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below, on the Exchange Date, 
the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged are immediately and 
irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this Exchange where the 
holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section 
below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee may not be us or one of our 
Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares, the 
nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the relevant holder of 
Subordinated Notes (unless, because the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, the 
nominee is deemed to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, in which case such issue shall occur as soon as practicable 
after the nominee ceases to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder).  
Attributable Proceeds means the net proceeds of sale of Ordinary Shares attributable to the Subordinated Notes of 
the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes, or where the provisions described in paragraph 4 of this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder section below apply, the Depositary Participant, actually received after deducting any applicable brokerage, 
stamp duty and other taxes.  
Ineligible Subordinated Holder means a holder of Subordinated Notes who is prohibited or restricted by any 
applicable law or regulation in force in Australia (including but not limited to Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act, the

Australia and Part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) of Australia) from being offered, holding or 
acquiring Ordinary Shares provided that if the relevant prohibition or restriction only applies to the holder of 
Subordinated Notes in respect of some of its Subordinated Notes, it shall only be treated as an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder in respect of those Subordinated Notes and not in respect of the balance of its Subordinated Notes), and 
includes a Foreign Subordinated Holder. We will be entitled to treat a holder of Subordinated Notes as not being an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder unless the holder of Subordinated Notes has otherwise notified us after the issue date 
and prior to the Exchange Date. 
Foreign Subordinated Holder means: 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes whose address in the register is a place outside Australia; or 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes who we believe may not be a resident of Australia and we are not satisfied 
that the laws of the country in which we believe the holder of Subordinated Notes is resident permit the

offer of Ordinary Shares to, or holding or acquisition of Ordinary Shares by, the holder of Subordinated Notes 
(but we will not be bound to enquire into those laws), either unconditionally or after compliance with 
conditions which we, in our absolute discretion, regards as acceptable and not unduly onerous. 
2. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and the holder of Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or a nominee 
for a common depository for any one or more Depositary (such Depositary or nominee for a common depository 
acting in such capacity as is specified in the rules and regulations of the relevant Depositary or Depositaries) then, on 
the Exchange Date, the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares from us) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged 
are immediately and irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this 
Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee 
may not be us or one of our Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that they are dealt with in 
accordance with the provisions described in paragraphs 3 and 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below. 
3. 
Where Ordinary Shares are issued to one or more nominees in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 
2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above, each person who is for the time being shown in the records of the 
relevant Depositary or Depositaries as the holder of the corresponding Subordinated Notes immediately prior to 
Exchange (Depositary Participant, in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a Depositary as to the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of such Subordinated Notes standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive 
and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) may, no later than 30 days following the relevant 
Exchange Date (Depositary Cut-Off Date), provide to us and the relevant nominee: 
 
its name and address for entry into any register of title and receipt of any certificate or holding statement in 
respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange; 
 
the security account details of the holder of Subordinated Notes in CHESS or such other account to which the 
Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange are to be credited; and 
 
such other information as is reasonably requested by us, 
and, if it does so, the nominee will transfer the relevant Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant as soon as 
possible thereafter. 
4. 
If a Depositary Participant: 
 
fails to provide the information required by the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section above by the Depositary Cut-off Date; 
 
notifies us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares on or prior to the Depositary Cut-off Date; or 
 
would be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder if the Depositary Participants name had been entered in a 
register as the owner of the Subordinated Notes immediately prior to Exchange, 
then, with effect from the Depositary Cut-off Date, the Depositary Participant will cease to be entitled to receive the 
relevant Ordinary Shares and, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares after the Depositary Cut-off Date, the

relevant nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the Depositary 
Participant. 
5. 
Where a nominee is to be issued with Ordinary Shares under the provisions described in this section, on and from the 
date of issue of those Ordinary Shares, the relevant Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) are taken to have been Exchanged and the only rights of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or the Depositary Participant (as the case may be) in respect of such Subordinated Notes (or 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are:  
 
where the provisions described in paragraphs 1 or 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above 
applies, to require the nominee to pay it the Attributable Proceeds; or  
 
where the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above applies and 
the Depositary Participant complies with the conditions set forth in that paragraph, to require the nominee 
to effect a transfer of those Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant. 
6. 
If, where the provisions described in this section apply: 
 
the Exchange fails to take effect; and 
 
we have not otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the relevant nominee within five Business Days after the 
date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then the rights of the holders of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) are immediately and irrevocably terminated as described in Automatic 
Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot 
occur above. 
Exchange of a percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount  
If, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is necessary to Exchange a 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount, the provisions described in this section  Exchange Mechanics will apply to 
the Exchange as if references to the Outstanding Principal Amount were references to the relevant percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount to be Exchanged. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is not 
necessary to Exchange all of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, and either (a) a holder of 
Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or nominee for a common depository for any one or more Depositaries or (b) an Exchange of 
some only of the Subordinated Notes could result in the Exchange being applied among holders of Subordinated Notes or 
Depositary Participants (as applicable) other than on a pro-rata basis, the Exchange will be effected by the relevant percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note being Exchanged. 
Holder of Subordinated Notes acknowledgements  
Each holder of Subordinated Notes irrevocably:  
 
consents to becoming a member of CBA upon Exchange of the Subordinated Notes as required by the conditions 
described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section and agrees to be bound by our Constitution, in each 
case in respect of the Ordinary Shares issued to such holder of Subordinated Notes on Exchange;  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
23 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
unless (x) it has given notice in accordance with the provisions described in  Exchange where the holder of 
Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder above that it 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of the Exchange or (y) it is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, 
acknowledges and agrees that it is obliged to accept Ordinary Shares if it holds Subordinated Notes that are required 
to be Exchanged as and when required by the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes 
section notwithstanding anything that might otherwise affect Exchange including: 
 
any change in our financial position since the issue of such Subordinated Notes; 
 
any disruption to the market or potential market for the Ordinary Shares or to capital markets generally;  
 
any breach by us of any obligation in connection with the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
any failure to or delay in exchange, conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities; and 
 
acknowledges and agrees that: 
 
it will not have any rights to vote in respect of any Exchange or Write Down; 
 
it has no claim against us for any loss it may suffer arising in connection with any Exchange or Write Down;  
 
it has no rights to compensation from, or any other remedies against, us or any other member of the CBA 
Group on account of the failure of us to issue Ordinary Shares if we are for any reason prevented from doing 
so;  
 
Exchange is not subject to any conditions other than those expressly provided for in Automatic Exchange 
or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event and this Exchange Mechanics 
section; and 
 
it has no right to request Exchange or to determine whether (or in what circumstances) the Subordinated 
Notes it holds are Exchanged. 
Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  
Each Subordinated Note will be redeemed on the maturity date for its Outstanding Principal Amount unless we have previously 
conducted a Subordinated Note Repurchase or Subordinated Note Redemption or Exchanged or Written Down the 
Subordinated Notes in full. 
APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase 
A Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase may only occur before the maturity date if APRA has given 
its prior written approval to the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. Approval is at the discretion 
of APRA. Holders of Subordinated Notes should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for a Subordinated Note 
Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. 
Additionally, we may only conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase before the maturity date 
if either:  
 
before or concurrently with the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase we replace the 
Subordinated Notes with a capital instrument which is of the same or better quality (for the purposes of APRAs 
prudential standards as they are applied to the CBA Group at the relevant time) than the Subordinated Notes and the 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
24 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
replacement of the Subordinated Notes is done under conditions that are sustainable for the income capacity of CBA; 
or 
 
we obtain confirmation from APRA that APRA is satisfied, having regard to the capital position of the CBA Level 1 
Group and the CBA Level 2 Group, that we do not have to replace the Subordinated Notes.  
Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be redeemed at the option of a holder of such Subordinated Note. 
As described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase, 
we may redeem prior to the maturity date in whole but not in part, the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note 
Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events, as described below. Because the 2034 
Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement specifies that an issuer call is applicable, we may also redeem all of the 2034 
Subordinated Notes on the Optional Redemption Date. The Optional Redemption Date will be September 12, 2029.  
Any Subordinated Note Redemption as described below under Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of 
certain tax events and Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events will be made at 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, which shall be equal to 100% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes redeemed pursuant to the Subordinated Note Redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but 
excluding) the Subordinated Note Redemption Date. If we have provided a notice of Subordinated Note Redemption, the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes called for Subordinated Note Redemption shall become due on the 
Subordinated Note Redemption Date. On and after the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, unless we default in payment of 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, interest shall cease to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes. 
If we elect to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption, we will provide holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agent 
with at least 20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business Days) irrevocable notice (for the avoidance of doubt, an 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption). Notices of a 
Subordinated Note Redemption shall be given by us in writing and for so long as any Subordinated Notes are held by the 
Depositary, given to each holder in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Depositary relating to the delivery of 
notices, or mailed to their last addresses appearing on the register of the Subordinated Notes. Notices of a Subordinated Note 
Redemption shall specify the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, the place 
or places of payment and that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Notes which are the 
subject of the Subordinated Note Redemption.  
All Subordinated Notes which are the subject of a Subordinated Note Redemption will be cancelled forthwith and all our 
liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged.  
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events  
Subject to the requirements described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we receive an opinion from reputable legal counsel or other 
tax adviser in Australia, experienced in such matters, to the effect that there is a material risk that as a result of a change in laws 
of Australia (including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment which has been or will be 
introduced), we would be exposed to a more than de minimis adverse tax consequence in relation to the Subordinated Notes 
other than a tax consequence we expected as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected as at the date 
of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Tax Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of the Subordinated 
Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date. 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
25 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If we choose to redeem the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a 
Tax Event, then immediately prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption of Subordinated Notes pursuant 
to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated 
Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right 
to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which we would be subject to the adverse tax consequence. Such notice 
shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred and state that we have 
elected to exercise our option to conduct the Subordinated Note Redemption in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated 
Notes. 
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we determine that as a result of a change in the laws of 
Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards (including following any announcement of a prospective change or 
amendment which has been or will be introduced) all, some or a percentage of all or some Subordinated Notes are not or will 
not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the CBA Group under APRAs prudential standards (as amended from time to time), other 
than as a result of a change of treatment expected by us as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected 
as at the date of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Regulatory Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of 
the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date.  
If we choose to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a Regulatory Event, then immediately 
prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption pursuant to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent 
an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable 
detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have 
occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which all, some or a percentage of all or some of the Subordinated Notes 
will cease to be treated as Tier 2 Capital. Such notice shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note 
Redemption have occurred and state that we have elected to exercise our option to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption 
in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Notes. 
Subordinated Note Repurchase 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, we or any member of the CBA Group may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and 
regulations, at any time purchase Subordinated Notes in the open market, by tender to all or some of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or by private agreement or otherwise at any price (Subordinated Note Repurchase). All Subordinated 
Notes repurchased by us or any member of the CBA Group as a result of a Subordinated Note Repurchase will be cancelled 
forthwith and all our liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged. 
Mergers and similar transactions 
We are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another person. We are also permitted to sell substantially all of our 
assets to another person, or to buy substantially all of the assets of another person.  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
26 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met: 
 
where we merge out of existence or sell our assets, except as otherwise indicated below, the other person must be an 
entity organized as a corporation, trust or partnership, it must expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of and interest, if any, on the Subordinated Notes and the performance of every 
covenant included in the Subordinated Notes; 
 
we deliver to the holders of the Subordinated Notes an officers certificate and opinion of counsel, each stating that 
the consolidation, merger, sale, lease or purchase of assets complies with the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not cause a default on the Subordinated Notes, and we must not 
already be in default under the Subordinated Notes, unless the merger or other transaction would cure the default. 
If such person is not organized and validly existing under the laws of Australia, it must expressly agree: 
 
to indemnify the holder of the Subordinated Notes against any tax, assessment or governmental charge required to be 
withheld or deducted from any payment to such holder as a consequence of such merger, sale of assets or other 
transaction, provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any deduction or withholding imposed or 
required pursuant to Section 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official 
interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or 
regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code, and shall not require the payment of additional 
amounts on account of any such withholding or deduction); and 
 
that all payments pursuant to the Subordinated Notes must be made without withholding or deduction for or on 
account of any tax of whatever nature imposed or levied on behalf of the jurisdiction of organization of such person, 
or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such tax is required by such jurisdiction or any 
such subdivision or authority to be withheld or deducted, in which case such person will pay such additional amounts 
in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Subordinated Notes after such withholding or deduction 
will equal the amount which would have been received in respect of the Subordinated Notes in the absence of such 
withholding or deduction, subject to the same exceptions as would apply with respect to the payment by us of 
additional amounts in respect of the Subordinated Notes (substituting the jurisdiction of organization of such person 
for Australia). 
Upon any such consolidation or merger, or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Issuer 
substantially as an entirety in accordance with the provisions described in this Mergers and similar transactions section 
above, the successor person formed by such consolidation or into which we are merged or to which such conveyance, transfer 
or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, us under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes with the same effect as if the successor person had been named as the Issuer therein 
and herein and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor person shall be relieved of all obligations and 
covenants under the Subordinated Notes and under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the above, the terms of the Subordinated Notes do not prevent us from consolidating with or merging into any 
other person or conveying, transferring or leasing our respective properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any 
person, or from permitting any person to consolidate with or merge into us or to convey, transfer or lease our respective 
properties and assets substantially as an entirety to us where such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease is: 
 
required by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) under law and prudential regulation 
applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia (including, without limitation, the Australian Banking Act or the 
Australian FSBT Act, as used herein, and any amendments thereto, rules thereunder and any successor laws, 
amendments and rules); or  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
27 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
determined by us or by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) to be necessary in order for 
us to be managed in a sound and prudent manner or for us or APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official 
appointed by it) to resolve any financial difficulties affecting us, in each case in accordance with law and prudential 
regulation applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia. 
It is possible that the merger, sale of assets or other transaction would cause some of our property to become subject to a 
mortgage or other legal mechanism giving lenders preferential rights in that property over other lenders or over our general 
creditors if we fail to pay them back. 
Payment of additional amounts  
We will pay all amounts that we are required to pay on the Subordinated Notes without withholding or deduction for, or on 
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed or levied by or on behalf of 
Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. This obligation will not apply, however, if those taxes, 
duties, assessments or other governmental charges are required by Australia or any such subdivision or taxing authority to be 
withheld or deducted (including withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in section 1471(b) of 
the Code). If that were to occur, we will pay additional amounts of, or in respect of, the principal of, and any premium and 
interest on, the affected Subordinated Notes (additional amounts) that are necessary so that the net amounts paid to the 
holders of those Subordinated Notes, after deduction or withholding, will equal the amounts of principal and any premium and 
interest that we would have had to pay on those Subordinated Notes if the deduction or withholding had not been required 
except that our obligation to pay additional amounts in relation to the Subordinated Notes will not apply to: 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed 
but for the fact that the holder of the affected Subordinated Note: 
 
was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment 
or was physically present in, Australia or otherwise had some connection with Australia other than only 
owning that Subordinated Note, or receiving payments under that Subordinated Note; 
 
presented that Subordinated Note for payment in Australia, unless he or she was required to present that 
Subordinated Note for payment and it could not have been presented for payment anywhere else; or 
 
presented that Subordinated Note more than 30 days after the date payment became due on that 
Subordinated Note or was provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have 
been entitled to the additional amounts on presenting the Subordinated Note for payment on any day during 
that 30 day period;  
 
any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge 
or any withholding or deduction on account of those taxes; 
 
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from 
payments of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on the affected Subordinated Note; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
holder or the beneficial owner of the affected Subordinated Note did not comply with our request: 
 
to provide information concerning his or her nationality, residence or identity; or 
 
to make a declaration or other similar claim or satisfy any requirement for information or reporting,

which, in the case of each of the two preceding bullet points, is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or 
administrative practice of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in Australia as a condition to an 
exemption from all or part of the withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
person who receives the payment is our associate as defined in section 128F of the Australian Tax Act; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duties, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by 
reason of the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia giving a notice under Section 255 of the 
Australian Tax Act or Section 260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 of the Commonwealth of 
Australia; 
 
any withholding or deduction due to a determination having been made under Part IVA of the Australian Tax Act (or 
any modification thereof or provision substituted therefor) by the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of 
Australia that withholding tax is payable in respect of a payment in circumstances where that payment would not have 
been subject to withholding tax because of a scheme which had the dominant purpose of causing the payment not to 
be subject to withholding tax;  
 
any withholding or deduction that is imposed by reason of the failure of a person entitled to such payment to perfect 
an exemption from any withholding or deduction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of any payment 
being made through an intermediary that is subject to withholding or deduction) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 
through 1474 of the Code and any regulations or agreements thereunder or official interpretations thereof; or 
 
any combination of the foregoing bullet points.  
The term associate is widely defined for the purposes of section 128F of the Australian Tax Act. It would include: 
 
a person who controls a majority voting interest in us or is able to sufficiently influence us; 
 
any trust under which we, or any of our subsidiaries, can benefit; and 
 
any entity which we can sufficiently influence or in which we have a majority voting interest, even where that entity 
acts as trustee. 
No additional amounts shall be payable with respect to any payment of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of, 
or any interest on, any Subordinated Note to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner 
of such payment to the extent that payment would, under the laws of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of 
Australia, be treated as being derived or received for tax purposes by a beneficiary or settlor of that fiduciary or a member of 
that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to those additional amounts had it been the actual 
holder of the affected Subordinated Note. 
In addition, any amounts to be paid on the Subordinated Notes will be paid, and any Ordinary Shares to be delivered as a result 
of an Exchange of such Subordinated Notes will be delivered, net of any deduction, withholding, interest or penalty imposed or 
required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official interpretations 
thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or 
practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such 
Sections of the Code (a FATCA Withholding), and no additional amounts will be required to be paid and no additional Ordinary 
Shares will be required to be delivered on account of any such FATCA Withholding. Each holder shall be deemed to authorize us 
to remit, or otherwise deal with, any amounts and Ordinary Shares comprising a FATCA Withholding and report information in 
accordance with applicable requirements connected therewith. 
For personal use only

Whenever we refer in this document, in any context, to the payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on any 
Subordinated Note or the net proceeds received on the sale or Exchange of any Subordinated Note, we mean to include the 
payment of additional amounts to the extent that, in that context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable. 
Any additional amounts payable on Subordinated Notes will be subordinated in right of payment, see  Status of Subordinated 
Notes above. 
Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange 
We may, without the consent of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, provided that the Substitution Conditions (as defined 
below) are satisfied, by giving notice to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and holders of the Subordinated Notes, substitute for 
ourself a non-operating holding company within the meaning of the Australian Banking Act (NOHC) as the issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (Successor). 
The notice shall specify the date on which the substitution is to take effect (the Date of Substitution).  
Substitution Conditions 
The Substitution Conditions are: 
 
by entering into a deed poll and such other documents (if any) as may be necessary to give full effect to the 
substitution (the Successor Documents), the Successor agrees with effect on and from the Date of Substitution, to 
deliver NOHC Ordinary Shares under all circumstances when we would otherwise have been required to deliver 
Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms and conditions as set out in the Subordinated Notes (with all necessary 
modifications);  
 
unless otherwise approved by APRA in writing, the Successor agrees that in all circumstances where the Successor 
delivers fully paid NOHC Ordinary Shares under the Successor Documents, the Successor or another entity (which is a 
parent entity) will simultaneously subscribe for Ordinary Shares in such amount as may be necessary to ensure that 
the capital position of our Level 1 Group and our Level 2 Group is equivalent to the position if such Successor 
Documents had not been entered into and we were required to issue the Ordinary Shares; 
 
the NOHC Ordinary Shares are or are to be quoted on ASX, and the Successor agrees to use all reasonable endeavours 
and furnish all such documents, information and undertakings as may be reasonably necessary in order to procure 
quotation of NOHC Ordinary Shares issued under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes on the securities 
exchanges on which the NOHC Ordinary Shares are quoted at the time of delivery; 
 
both we and the Successor have obtained APRA approval and all other necessary authorizations, regulatory and 
governmental approvals and consents for such substitution and for the performance by the Successor of its obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes and the documents effecting substitution; 
 
if the Successor does not have a place of business in New York, the Successor has appointed a process agent in New 
York to receive service of process on its behalf in relation to any legal proceedings arising out of or in connection with 
the Subordinated Notes;  
 
the Successor has, in our reasonable opinion, the financial capacity to satisfy its obligations under the Subordinated 
Notes;  
 
we have used all reasonable endeavours to give an irrevocable notice to the holders of the Subordinated Notes as 
soon as practicable before the Board initiates a restructure of the CBA Group and a NOHC becomes our ultimate 
holding company (a NOHC Event), but no later than 10 Business Days before the NOHC Event occurs, specifying the 
amendments to the Subordinated Notes which will be made under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
30 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
in connection with the substitution of a NOHC as the issuer of Ordinary Shares on Exchange and such amended terms 
will have effect on and from the date specified in the notice; and 
 
the Successor will not be deemed to be an investment company required to register under the U.S. Investment 
Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
Effect of substitution of Successor 
If the relevant requirements set out in Substitution Conditions have been completed, on and from the Date of Substitution: 
 
we (or any corporation which has previously assumed our obligations) will be released from any obligation we would 
otherwise have under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes to issue Ordinary Shares to holders of the 
Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; and 
 
references to Ordinary Shares in the Subordinated Notes (other than the reference contained in the first two bullets 
under Substitution Conditions and in the definitions of Issue Date VWAP and VWAP Period (to the extent the 
reference applies to Issue Date VWAP only)) and the Terms Agreement will be taken to be references to the NOHC 
Ordinary Shares.  
Default, remedies and waiver of default  
Subordinated Note events of default 
A Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes if: 
(A) 
we fail to pay any amount due in respect of the Subordinated Notes and such default continues for a period of 15 
Business Days and is continuing, provided that no Subordinated Note Event of Default shall arise on account of any 
non-payment if we withhold, deduct or refuse to make the payment:  
 
in order to comply with any law or regulation or with the order of any court of competent jurisdiction, in 
each case applicable to such payment; or 
 
in case of doubt as to the validity or applicability of any such law, regulation or order, in accordance with 
advice given as to such validity or applicability, at any time during the said period of 15 Business Days, by 
independent legal advisers;  
 
to the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would not be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the Holder of Subordinated Notes); or 
(B) 
an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order successfully appealed or permanently 
stayed within 30 Business Days), or an effective resolution is passed, for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not 
elsewhere).  
Consequences of a Subordinated Note Event of Default 
If a Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes: 
 
as described under paragraph (A) of Subordinated Note events of default above, any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may institute proceedings: 
 
to recover the amount we have failed to pay, provided that we may only be compelled to pay that amount to 
the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
31 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the holder of the Subordinated 
Notes); 
 
for specific performance of any other obligation in respect of the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not elsewhere); or 
 
as described under paragraph (B) Subordinated Note events of default above, the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately due and payable for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid 
interest up to (but excluding) the date of commencement of our Winding-Up and any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may, subject to the provisions described in How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt, prove in our 
Winding-Up in respect of this amount. 
A holder of Subordinated Notes has no right to accelerate payment or exercise any other remedies (including any right to sue for 
damages) as a consequence of any Subordinated Note Event of Default other than as set out in this section.  
Modification of the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement and waiver of covenants  
The prior written approval of APRA is required to modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, or to give consents or waivers in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes or take other actions where such modification, amendment, supplement, consent, waiver or other action 
may affect the eligibility of the Subordinated Notes as Tier 2 Capital of CBA (including, for the avoidance of doubt, waivers of any 
of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as they affect the Subordinated Notes, or in the Subordinated Notes).  
If we are able to obtain APRAs prior written approval, there are three types of changes we can make to the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes and these changes might subject the holders to U.S. federal tax.  
Changes requiring each holders approval 
First, there are changes that cannot be made without the consent or the affirmative vote or approval of each holder affected by 
the change. Here is a list of those types of changes: 
 
change to due date for the payment of Outstanding Principal Amount of, or any installment of interest on any 
Subordinated Note; 
 
reduce the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated Note, the portion of any Outstanding Principal Amount 
that is payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the Subordinated Note, the interest rate or the Subordinated Note 
Early Redemption Amount, except as expressly provided in the terms of the Subordinated Notes; 
 
changes to the subordination provisions of a Subordinated Note in a manner adverse to the interests of any holder of 
the Subordinated Note; 
 
change the currency of any payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
change our obligation to pay additional amounts;  
 
change the place of payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes necessary to modify, amend or 
supplement the Fiscal Agency Agreement or the Subordinated Notes or to waive past defaults or future compliance; or

reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes required to adopt a resolution or 
the required quorum at any meeting of holders of Subordinated Notes at which a resolution is adopted. 
Changes not requiring approval  
The second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the Subordinated Notes. We may, without the vote or 
consent or affirmative vote or approval of any holder of Subordinated Notes, amend the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, if we are of the opinion that such alteration is: (i) of a 
formal, technical or minor nature; (ii) made to cure any ambiguity or correct any manifest error; (iii) necessary or expedient for 
the purposes of facilitating a substitution under the terms described in Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (including satisfying any requirement of APRA in connection with such a substitution); (iv) made 
to amend any date or time period stated, required or permitted in connection with any Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Exchange (including, without limitation, when the proceeds of a Subordinated Note Redemption are to be reinvested in a new 
security to be issued by us or a Related Body Corporate); (v) not materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated 
Notes as a whole (subject to the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval); or (vi) made to (subject to 
the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval) (x) alter the terms of any Subordinated Notes to align 
them with any Relevant Tier 2 Securities issued after the date of such Subordinated Notes; or (y) alter either or both of the 
definitions of Relevant Tier 1 Securities and Relevant Tier 2 Securities on account of the issue (after the date of issue of any 
Subordinated Notes) of capital instruments of the CBA Group, provided in each case of (vi)(x) and (vi)(y) such alteration is not 
materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated Notes as a whole.   
Changes requiring majority approval 
Any other change to the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, 
requires the following (in addition to the prior written approval of APRA):  
 
the written consent of the holders of at least 50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes 
affected by such change; or 
 
the adoption of a resolution at a meeting at which a quorum of holders of Subordinated Notes is present by at least 
50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes affected by such change represented at the 
meeting. 
The same 50% approval would be required for us to obtain a waiver of any of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement or 
the Subordinated Notes. Such covenants include the promises we make about merging, which we describe above under  
Mergers and similar transactions. If the holders approve a waiver of a covenant, we will not have to comply with it. 
If approved in accordance with the terms described in this section, then all holders of Subordinated Notes, including holders 
who did not provide their written consent or attend and vote at a relevant meeting and holders who voted in a manner contrary 
to the majority, will be bound by such change. 
The quorum at any meeting called to adopt a resolution will be persons holding or representing a majority in Outstanding 
Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes and, at any reconvened meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum, 25% of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes. For purposes of determining whether holders of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of Subordinated Notes required for any action or vote, or for any quorum, have taken the action or vote, or 
constitute a quorum, the Outstanding Principal Amount of any particular Subordinated Note may differ from its Outstanding 
Principal Amount at the maturity date but will not exceed its stated face amount upon original issuance. 
Unless otherwise indicated, we will be entitled to set any day as a record date for determining which holders of book-entry 
Subordinated Notes are entitled to make, take or give requests, demands, authorizations, directions, notices, consents, waivers 
or other action, or to vote on actions, authorized or permitted by the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. In

addition, record dates for any book-entry Subordinated Note may be set in accordance with procedures established by the 
Depositary from time to time. Therefore, record dates for book-entry Subordinated Notes may differ from those for other 
Subordinated Notes. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how 
approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the Fiscal Agency Agreement or any Subordinated Notes or request a 
waiver. 
Only outstanding Subordinated Notes are eligible 
Only holders of outstanding Subordinated Notes will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of Subordinated Notes. 
Also, we will count only outstanding Subordinated Notes in determining whether the various percentage requirements for 
taking action have been met. For these purposes, a Subordinated Note will not be outstanding: 
 
if it has been surrendered for cancellation;  
 
to the extent it has been Written Down; 
 
if we have called such Subordinated Note for a Subordinated Note Redemption or it has become due and payable at 
maturity or otherwise and we have deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or 
Subordinated Note Redemption;  
 
if it is in lieu of or in substitution for other Subordinated Notes that have been authenticated and delivered; 
 
if we are the direct or indirect owner; or  
 
if it has been Exchanged.  
Form, exchange and transfer of Subordinated Notes 
If any Subordinated Notes cease to be issued in registered global form, they will be issued:  
 
only in fully registered form;  
 
without interest coupons; and  
 
unless we indicate otherwise, in denominations of US$200,000 or integral multiple of US$1,000 in excess thereof. 
Holders may exchange their Subordinated Notes for Subordinated Notes of smaller denominations or combine them into fewer 
Subordinated Notes of larger denominations, as long as the total Outstanding Principal Amount is not changed.  
Holders may exchange or transfer their Subordinated Notes at the office of the Fiscal Agent. They may also replace lost, stolen, 
destroyed or mutilated Subordinated Notes at that office. We have appointed the Fiscal Agent to act as our agent for registering 
Subordinated Notes in the names of holders and transferring and replacing Subordinated Notes. We may appoint another entity 
to perform these functions or perform them ourselves. 
Holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their Subordinated Notes, but they may be required 
to pay for any tax or other governmental charge associated with the exchange or transfer. The transfer or exchange, and any 
replacement, will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holders proof of legal ownership. The transfer agent 
may require an indemnity before replacing any Subordinated Notes. 
We may appoint additional transfer agents or cancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. We may also approve a 
change in the office through which any transfer agent acts.

If any Subordinated Notes are redeemable pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption and we redeem less than all those 
Subordinated Notes, we may block the transfer or exchange of those Subordinated Notes during the period beginning 15 days 
before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to 
prepare the mailing, and refuse to register transfers of or exchange any Subordinated Note selected for redemption, except that 
we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any Subordinated Note being partially 
redeemed. 
If a Subordinated Note is issued as a Global Note, only the Depositary  i.e., DTC  will be entitled to transfer and exchange the 
Subordinated Note as described in this subsection, since the Depositary will be the sole holder of the Subordinated Note. 
The rules for exchange described above apply to exchange of Subordinated Notes for other Subordinated Notes of the same 
kind.  
Payment mechanics for Subordinated Notes 
Who receives payment? 
If interest is due on a Subordinated Note on an interest payment date, we will pay the interest to the person in whose name the 
Subordinated Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date relating to the interest payment date, see 
 Payment of interest below. If interest is due at the maturity date, we will pay the interest to the person entitled to receive 
the principal of the Subordinated Note. If principal or another amount besides interest is due on a Subordinated Note at the 
maturity date, we will pay the amount to the holder of the Subordinated Note against surrender of the Subordinated Note at a 
proper place of payment or, in the case of a Global Note, in accordance with the applicable policies of the Depositary, which will 
be DTC. 
Payment of interest 
For each interest payment date, the interest to be paid in arrears to (but excluding) the interest payment date shall be that 
which has accrued from (and including) the prior interest payment date. Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year 
comprised of twelve 30-day calendar months. If any interest payment date for the Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a 
Business Day, the interest payment shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment 
shall accrue for the period from and after the interest payment date. If the maturity date or any earlier Redemption Date falls on 
a day that is not a Business Day, payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest otherwise due on such day will be 
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such 
maturity date, or Redemption Date, as the case may be. 
No interest will accrue on any Subordinated Notes, or relevant percentage of Subordinated Notes, required to be Exchanged in 
the period from (and including) the interest payment date that immediately precedes the Exchange Date or (in the case where 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down) the Write Down Date to the Exchange Date or Write Down Date, as applicable.  
Interest rate reset 
If all of the 2034 Subordinated Notes have not been redeemed, repurchased, cancelled, Exchanged or Written Down by the 
Interest Reset Date, the interest, payable on the Outstanding Principal Amount semi-annually in arrears for the period from, and 
including, the Interest Reset Date to, but excluding, the maturity date shall be reset to a fixed rate per annum equaling the Reset 
Reference Rate plus the Spread. 
How we will make payments on Global Notes  
We will make payments on a Global Note in accordance with the applicable policies as in effect from time to time of the 
Depositary, which will be DTC. Under those policies, we will pay directly to the Depositary, or its nominee, and not to any 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
35 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the Global Note. An indirect owners right to receive those payments will be 
governed by the rules and practices of the Depositary and its participants. 
Paying Agent 
We may appoint one or more financial institutions to act as our paying agents, at whose designated offices Subordinated Notes 
in non-global entry form may be surrendered for payment at their maturity. We call each of those financial institutions a Paying 
Agent. We may add, replace or terminate Paying Agents from time to time; provided that at all times there will be a Paying 
Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. We may also choose to act as our own Paying Agent. Initially, we 
have appointed The Bank of New York Mellon, as the Paying Agent. We must notify the Fiscal Agent of changes in the Paying 
Agents.  
Unclaimed payments 
Regardless of who acts as Paying Agent, all money paid by us to a Paying Agent that remains unclaimed at the end of two years 
after the amount is due to a holder will be repaid to us. After that two-year period, the holder may look only to us for payment 
and not to the Fiscal Agent, any other Paying Agent or anyone else. 
Notices 
Notices to be given to holders of a Global Note will be given only to the Depositary, in accordance with its applicable policies as 
in effect from time to time. Notices to be given to holders of Subordinated Notes not in global form will be sent by mail to the 
respective addresses of the holders as they appear in the Fiscal Agents records, and will be deemed given when mailed. Neither 
the failure to give any notice to a particular holder, nor any defect in a notice given to a particular holder, will affect the 
sufficiency of any notice given to another holder. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for 
information on how they will receive notices. 
Nothing in the above paragraph affects the Exchange or Write Down of the Subordinated Notes as described under  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  Exchange. 
Our relationship with the Fiscal Agent 
The Bank of New York Mellon is serving as the Fiscal Agent for the Subordinated Notes issued under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement. The Bank of New York Mellon has provided services for us and our affiliates in the past and may do so in the future. 
Among other things, The Bank of New York Mellon serves as fiscal agent with regard to some of our other debt obligations. 
Successor fiscal agent 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that the Fiscal Agent may be removed by us at any time or may resign upon 30 days prior 
written notice to us or any shorter period that we accept, effective upon the acceptance by a successor fiscal agent of its 
appointment. The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that any successor fiscal agent must have an established place of business 
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and a combined capital and surplus in excess of US$50,000,000. We must 
notify the holders of the Subordinated Notes of the appointment of a successor fiscal agent. 
Governing law 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us, the subordination 
provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Status and Subordination of Subordinated Notes above, the Exchange 
and Write Down provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the 
occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event above and the substitution provisions described above under Substitution of a

connection with any action arising out of the sale of the Subordinated Notes or enforcement of the terms of the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement.

The information included in the following sections of this document is based on material in the Offering Circular and the 2039 
Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement. 
The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations and claims in respect of Subordinated Notes will 
rank in our Winding-Up after the claims of all Senior Ranking Obligations, pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking 
Securities and ahead of claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities, as further defined and described below under How the 
Subordinated Notes rank against other debt.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs prior to the maturity date or earlier Subordinated Note Redemption, we must Exchange all 
or some of the Subordinated Notes or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case 
may be and in an amount as determined as described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event below) for Ordinary Shares. A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing 
that it believes (i) an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA 
Group, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable or (ii) a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable. 
If, for any reason, an Exchange fails to take effect and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in 
respect of such Exchange within five Business Days after the occurrence of the applicable Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the 
rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest and 
to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes or the percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down. See Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event for more information.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If the amount of our Relevant Tier 1 Securities is not sufficient to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable, some or all 
of our Relevant Tier 2 Securities, including the Subordinated Notes, will be subject to Exchange or Write Down. See  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event below.  
A Subordinated Note Redemption may, subject to the terms described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated 
Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances, occur at our option, in whole but not in 
part, following the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events.  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued only in fully registered form in denominations of US$200,000 and integral multiples of 
US$1,000 in excess thereof (the Specified Denomination). 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
The Subordinated Notes will be issued under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. The Fiscal Agency Agreement and its associated 
documents, including the Subordinated Notes and the 2039 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, contain the full legal text 
of the matters described in this section entitled Description of the Subordinated Notes. This section is a summary only and 
does not describe every aspect of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. For example, in this section and the 
2039 Subordinated Notes Pricing Supplement, we use terms that have been given special meaning in the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement, but we describe the meaning of only the more important of those terms.  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us and the subordination, 
Exchange, Write Down and substitution provisions of the Subordinated Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the law applying in New South Wales, Australia.  
Copies of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the form of Subordinated Note are available for inspection during normal business 
hours at the office of the Fiscal Agent.  
The Fiscal Agent performs administrative duties for us such as sending interest payments and notices to holders. See  Our 
relationship with the Fiscal Agent below for more information about the Fiscal Agent.  
We may issue other debt securities  
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes do not limit our ability to incur other indebtedness or to issue other 
securities. Also, we are not subject to financial covenants or similar restrictions by the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt 
Loss absorption does not apply to our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
The requirement for a conversion or write down on account of our non-viability does not apply to an amount of our 
subordinated debt that was issued prior to January 1, 2013. Accordingly, holders of Subordinated Notes are likely to be in a 
worse position in the event we become non-viable than holders of our subordinated debt issued prior to January 1, 2013 
because that subordinated debt generally does not require that it be exchanged or written down upon the occurrence of a Non-
Viability Trigger Event.

Status of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will not be secured by any of our property or assets. Thus, by owning a Subordinated Note, a holder of 
a Subordinated Noted is an unsecured creditor. The Subordinated Notes will be unsecured, direct and subordinated obligations 
and will rank pari passu with Equal Ranking Securities.  
The liabilities which are preferred by law to the claim of a holder in respect of the Subordinated Notes are substantial. The terms 
and conditions of the Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of such liabilities which we may incur or assume from time to 
time. 
Each holder should be aware that, if we are in a Winding-Up, it is possible that a Non-Viability Trigger Event will have already 
occurred, following which the holders Subordinated Notes may be, or may have already been, Exchanged for Ordinary Shares or 
Written Down. See  How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt and  Default, remedies and waiver of default 
below for additional information on how subordination limits the ability of holders of Subordinated Notes to receive payment or 
pursue other rights if we default or have certain other financial difficulties.  
Claims in respect of Subordinated Notes rank in our Winding-Up: 
 
after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims preferred by applicable laws;  
 
pari passu with claims in respect of Equal Ranking Securities; and  
 
ahead of all claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims referred to in Sections 563AA and 563A of 
the Corporations Act.  
The applicable laws referred to above include (but are not limited to) Sections 13A and 16 of the Australian Banking Act and 
Section 86 of the Reserve Bank Act. These provisions provide that, in the event that we becomes unable to meet our obligations 
or suspend payment, our assets in Australia are to be available to meet our liabilities to, among others, APRA, the RBA and 
holders of protected accounts held in Australia, in priority to all other liabilities, including the Subordinated Notes. 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. The Subordinated Notes do not constitute 
deposit liabilities or protected accounts for us in Australia for the purposes of the Australian Banking Act and are not insured or 
guaranteed by the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any government, governmental agency or 
compensation scheme of the United States, Australia or any other jurisdiction or by any other party.   
In our Winding-Up, payments on each Subordinated Note are subject to: (i) all holders of Senior Ranking Obligations being paid 
in full before any payment is made to holders of Subordinated Notes; and (ii) holders of Subordinated Notes and holders of 
Equal Ranking Securities being paid on a pro-rata basis.  
We expect that from time to time we will incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that will constitute Senior Ranking 
Obligations. The Subordinated Notes do not limit the amount of our obligations that can rank ahead of the Subordinated Notes 
that we may incur or assume in the future. 
Equal Ranking Securities means any instrument that ranks in our Winding-Up as the most junior claim in our Winding-Up 
ranking senior to Junior Ranking Securities, and includes: 
 
if on issue at the commencement of our Winding-Up, the JPY20,000,000,000 Perpetual Subordinated Callable 
Fixed/Floating Rate Reverse Dual Currency Securities issued by us in 1999; and 
 
any other instruments, present and future, issued after January 1, 2013 as instruments constituting Tier 2 Capital.

45 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Junior Ranking Securities means:  
 
any instrument, present and future, issued by us which qualifies as Tier 1 Capital (or, in the case of any instrument 
issued prior to January 1, 2013), was treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in accordance with the prudential standards 
which applied prior to January 1, 2013, irrespective of whether or not such instrument is treated as constituting Tier 1 
Capital in accordance with any transitional arrangements provided by APRA or which rank or are expressed to rank 
equally with such securities in our Winding-Up; and  
 
all of our Ordinary Shares. 
Senior Ranking Obligations means all our present and future deposits and other liabilities, securities and other obligations 
which would be entitled to be admitted in our Winding-Up (and including, but not limited to, obligations in respect of 
instruments issued before January 1, 2013 as Tier 2 Capital) other than Equal Ranking Securities and Junior Ranking Securities.  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, none of us, any holder of a Subordinated Note or any person claiming 
through us or a holder of a Subordinated Note has any right of set-off in respect of any amounts owed by one person to the 
other person. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement, each holder irrevocably acknowledges and 
agrees that: 
 
the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes are a debt subordination for the purposes of Section 563C of 
the Australian Corporations Act;  
 
the debt subordination is not affected by our act or omission, or any act or omission of any holder of Senior Ranking 
Obligations, which might otherwise affect holders of Subordinated Notes at law or in equity; 
 
it must not exercise its voting rights as an unsecured creditor in our Winding-Up or administration in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes to defeat the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
it must pay or deliver to the liquidator any amount or asset received on account of its claim in the Winding-Up in 
excess of its entitlement under the subordination provisions of the Subordinated Notes. 
For the avoidance of doubt, but subject as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence 
of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot occur, if a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred, 
holders of Subordinated Notes will rank in our Winding-Up as holders of the number of Ordinary Shares to which they became 
entitled as described below under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event. 
Form of Subordinated Notes  
The Subordinated Notes will be issued in global  i.e., book-entry  form represented by a global security registered in the 
name of a depositary, which will be the holder of all the Subordinated Notes represented by the global security.  
Subordinated Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (Securities Act) will be represented by one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Rule 144A Global Note), 
registered in the name of a nominee of The Depositary Trust Company (DTC). Subordinated Notes sold outside of the United 
States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be represented by 
one or more global Subordinated Notes (each, a Regulation S Global Note and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the 
Global Notes) registered in the name of a nominee of DTC or a common depositary for DTC (the Depositary).

Those who own beneficial interests in a Global Note will do so through participants in the Depositarys securities clearance 
system, and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the Depositary and its 
participants.  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  
Non-Viability Trigger Event 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes: 
 
an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write down of capital instruments of the CBA Group, 
is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable; or 
 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-
viable. 
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital instruments which must be Exchanged, Written Down, converted or written 
down (as applicable). 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, we must Exchange in accordance with Exchange and No further rights if Exchange 
cannot occur below such number of Subordinated Notes (or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) as is equal (taking into account any conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities 
as defined below) to the aggregate face value of capital instruments which APRA has notified us must be exchanged, converted 
or written down (or, if APRA has not so notified us, such number or, if we so determine, such percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note as is necessary to satisfy APRA that we will no longer be non-viable). If a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies us in writing that it believes a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent 
support, is necessary because, without it, we would become non-viable, we must Exchange all Subordinated Notes.  
In determining the number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, which must be Exchanged in accordance with this section, we will: 
 
first, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 1 Securities whose terms require or permit, 
or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange of the 
Subordinated Notes; 
 
secondly, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or 
permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange 
of the Subordinated Notes; and  
 
thirdly, if exchange, conversion or write down of those securities is not sufficient, Exchange (in the case of the 
Subordinated Notes) or exchange, convert or write down (in the case of any other Relevant Tier 2 Securities) on a pro-
rata basis or in a manner that is otherwise, in our opinion, fair and reasonable, the Subordinated Notes and any other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to require or permit, them to be 
exchanged, converted or written down in that manner (subject to such adjustments as we may determine to take into 
account the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares and any Subordinated Notes or other 
Relevant Tier 2 Securities remaining on issue),  
but such determination will not impede the immediate Exchange of the relevant number of Subordinated Notes or percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be).  
Relevant Security means a Relevant Tier 1 Security and a Relevant Tier 2 Security. 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
47 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Relevant Tier 1 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 1 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
Relevant Tier 2 Security means a security forming part of our Tier 2 Capital on a Level 1 basis or Level 2 basis.  
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, then: 
 
the relevant number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note, must be Exchanged immediately upon occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event in accordance with 
Exchange and Exchange Mechanics below and the Exchange will be irrevocable; 
 
we must give notice as soon as practicable that Exchange has occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the 
holders of Subordinated Notes; 
 
the notice must specify the date on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred; and 
 
the notice must specify the details of the Exchange process, including any details which were taken into account in 
relation to the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of Ordinary Shares, and the impact on any 
Subordinated Notes remaining on issue. 
Failure to undertake any of the steps in the paragraph above does not prevent, invalidate or otherwise impede Exchange or 
Write Down, respectively. 
For the purposes of the foregoing, where the specified currency of the face value of Relevant Tier 1 Securities, Relevant Tier 2 
Securities and/or Subordinated Notes (as applicable) is not Australian Dollars, we may treat them as if converted into Australian 
Dollars using the Exchange Date Cross Rate. 
Exchange 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be Exchanged at the option of a holder thereof. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred and all or some of the Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are required to be Exchanged in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then: 
 
Exchange of the relevant Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each 
Subordinated Note will occur in accordance with Non-Viability Trigger Event and Exchange Mechanics 
immediately upon the date of occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event; and 
 
the entry of the corresponding Subordinated Note in each relevant holding of a holder of Subordinated Notes in the 
register of the Depositary will constitute an entitlement of that holder of Subordinated Notes (or, where the provisions 
described under Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, of the nominee) to the relevant number of 
Ordinary Shares (and, if applicable, also to any remaining balance of the Subordinated Notes or remaining percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note), and we will recognize the holder of Subordinated 
Notes (or, where Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder applies, the nominee) as having been issued the 
relevant Ordinary Shares for all purposes, 
in each case without the need for any further act or step by us, the holder of the Subordinated Note or any other person (and 
we will, as soon as possible thereafter and without delay on our part, take any appropriate procedural steps to record such 
Exchange, including to procure the updating of the register of the Depositary and the Ordinary Share register and seek quotation 
of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange).

48 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
In relation to an Exchange, we shall notify the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary of the percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note that has been Exchanged and instruct the Fiscal Agent and the Depositary to reflect this 
Exchange in the relevant Global Note or other certificate representing the Subordinated Notes so that the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of such Subordinated Note is reduced by the relevant percentage. In the case of an Exchange of only part of a 
Subordinated Note, upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Note, we will issue a new Subordinated Note in the 
name of the holder with a reduced Outstanding Principal Amount reflecting the Exchange.  
For the avoidance of doubt: 
 
nothing in the Subordinated Notes will allow a payment to be made to a holder of Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; 
and 
 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption issued as 
described in Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  Redemption of Subordinated 
Notes under certain circumstances. 
Exchange means the exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes or a percentage of each Subordinated Note for Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Notes and Exchanged has a corresponding meaning. 
No further rights if Exchange cannot occur 
If for any reason, Exchange of any Subordinated Note or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated 
Note required to be Exchanged described under Non-Viability Trigger Event fails to take effect as described in Exchange 
and we have not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares required to be issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business 
Days after the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the rights of the relevant holder of Subordinated 
Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest, and the right to receive Ordinary Shares) in 
relation to such Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately and irrevocably terminated and such termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the 
occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event (Written Down). We must give notice as soon as practicable that Write Down has 
occurred to the Depositary, the Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes, and the notice must specify the date on 
which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred.  
Appointment of Appointed Person 
Each holder of a Subordinated Note, on behalf of itself and (in the case of any Global Note) any person owning an indirect 
interest in such Subordinated Note, irrevocably: 
 
appoints us and our duly authorized officers and any liquidator, administrator, statutory manager or other similar 
official of CBA (each an Appointed Person) severally to be the attorney of the holder and the agents of the holder, 
with the power in the name and on behalf of the holder to: 
 
do all such acts and things (including, without limitation signing all documents, instruments or transfers or 
instructing CHESS) as may, in the opinion of the Appointed Person, be necessary or desirable to be done in 
order to give effect to, record or perfect an Exchange or Write Down (as applicable); 
 
do all other things which an Appointed Person reasonably believes to be necessary or desirable to give effect 
to the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
appoint in turn its own agent or delegate; and 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
49 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
authorizes and directs us and/or the Fiscal Agent to make such entries in the register, including amendments and 
additions to the register, which we and/or the Fiscal Agent may consider necessary or desirable to record an Exchange 
or Write Down (as applicable). 
The power of attorney to be given by Subordinated Note holders in respect of the Subordinated Notes will be given for valuable 
consideration and to secure the performance by the Subordinated Note holder of the Subordinated Note holders obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes, will be irrevocable and will survive and not be affected by the subsequent disability or incapacity 
of the Subordinated Note holder (or, if such Subordinated Note holder is an entity, by its dissolution or termination). An 
Appointed Person will have no liability in respect of any acts duly performed in accordance with the power of attorney thereby 
given.  
Exchange Mechanics 
Exchange  
On the Exchange Date, subject to the conditions described in  Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot occur and  Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the 
holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, the following 
will apply: 
 
we will allot and issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares for each Subordinated Note (or percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) required to be Exchanged. The Exchange Number is, subject 
always to the Exchange Number being no greater than the Maximum Exchange Number, calculated according to the 
following formula: 
 
Exchange Number 
= 
Outstanding Principal Amount x Exchange Date Cross Rate 
P x VWAP 
where: 
P means 0.99. 
VWAP (expressed in Australian dollars and cents) means the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of 
Ordinary Shares traded on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period, subject to any adjustments made as described under 
 Adjustments to VWAP generally and  Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction, but the trades taken 
into account in determining such daily volume weighted average prices will exclude special crossings, crossings prior to 
the commencement of normal trading or during the closing phase or after hours adjustment phase, overnight 
crossings, overseas trades, trades pursuant to the exercise of options over Ordinary Shares, or any other trade 
determined by the Board in its discretion not to be reflective of normal trading in Ordinary Shares. 
VWAP Period means: 
 
in the case of the calculation of the Exchange Number, the period of five Business Days on which trading in 
Ordinary Shares took place immediately preceding (but not including) the Exchange Date; or 
 
in the case of the Issue Date VWAP, the period of 20 Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took 
place immediately preceding but excluding the issue date. 
Issue Date VWAP means the VWAP during the period of 20 Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took 
place immediately preceding but not including the issue date, as adjusted in accordance with the provisions described

(rounded to six decimal places) of the inverse A$/Specified Currency exchange rates published by the RBA at 
approximately 4:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on each of the Business Days during the five Business Day period immediately 
preceding (but excluding) the Exchange Date or, if such exchange rate is not published by the RBA on any of such 
Business Days, the Exchange Date Cross Rate will be the simple average of the inverse A$/Specified Currency exchange 
rate quoted by two or more independent market makers in that exchange rate, selected by us, on the Exchange Date. 
Maximum Exchange Number means a number calculated according to the following formula: 
Maximum 
Exchange 
Number 
= 
Outstanding Principal Amount x Issue Date Cross Rate 
0.20 x Issue Date VWAP 
Issue Date Cross Rate means (a) if the Specified Currency is Australian Dollars, 1; or (b) otherwise, the average 
(rounded to six decimal places) of the inverse A$/Specified Currency exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of

immediately preceding (but excluding) the issue date or, if such exchange rate is not published by the RBA on any of 
such Business Days, the Issue Date Cross Rate will be the simple average of the inverse A$/Specified Currency 
exchange rate quoted by two or more independent market makers in that exchange rate, selected by us, at 
approximately 4:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on the issue date. 
The rights of each holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of interest) in relation to each Subordinated Note that is 
being Exchanged (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note that is being Exchanged) will 
be immediately and irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) and we will apply that amount by way of 
payment for the subscription for the Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued under as described under the paragraph above. 
Each holder of Subordinated Notes is taken to have irrevocably directed that any amount payable under this section is to be 
applied as provided for in this section and no holder of Subordinated Notes has any right to payment in any other way. 
If the total number of additional Ordinary Shares to be allotted and issued in respect of the aggregate holding of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes includes a fraction of an Ordinary Share, that fraction of an Ordinary Share will be disregarded. 
Subject to the conditions described in Exchange Mechanics  Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not 
wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, where Subordinated Notes are Exchanged, we will allot 
and issue the Ordinary Shares to the holder of Subordinated Notes on the basis that the name and address set out in the register 
of holders (or, if not set out in the register, otherwise held by the Depositary) are the name and address for entry into any 
register of title and delivery of any certificate or holding statement in respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange.

Adjustments to VWAP generally 
For the purposes of calculating the VWAP under Exchange above:  
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the relevant VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted on ASX as 
cum dividend or cum any other distribution or entitlement and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary 
Shares after that date and those Ordinary Shares will no longer carry that dividend or any other distribution or 
entitlement, then the VWAP on the Business Days on which those Ordinary Shares have been quoted cum dividend or 
cum any other distribution or entitlement will be reduced by an amount (Cum Value) equal to:  
 
in the case of a cash dividend or other distribution, the amount of that dividend or other distribution;  
 
in the case of any other entitlement that is not a dividend or other distribution under the bullet above which 
is traded on ASX on any of those Business Days, the volume weighted average price of all such entitlements 
sold on ASX during the relevant VWAP Period on the Business Days on which those entitlements were traded 
(excluding trades of the kind that would be excluded in determining VWAP under the definition of that 
term); or 
 
in the case of any other entitlement which is not traded on ASX during the VWAP Period, the value of the 
entitlement as reasonably determined by our Board; and 
 
where, on some or all of the Business Days in the VWAP Period, Ordinary Shares have been quoted as ex dividend or 
ex any other distribution or entitlement, and Subordinated Notes will be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares which would 
be entitled to receive the relevant dividend, distribution or entitlement, the VWAP on the Business Days on which 
those Ordinary Shares have been quoted ex dividend or ex any other distribution or entitlement will be increased by 
the Cum Value. 
Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction 
Where, during the relevant VWAP Period, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because the Ordinary 
Shares are reconstructed, consolidated, divided or reclassified (not involving any payment or other compensation to or by 
holders of Ordinary Shares) (Reclassification) into a lesser or greater number, the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period 
which falls before the date on which trading in Ordinary Shares is conducted on a post Reclassification basis will be adjusted by 
multiplying the daily VWAP for each day in the VWAP Period by the following formula: 
A 
B 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares immediately after the Reclassification. 
Any adjustment made by us in accordance with the paragraph above will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated 
Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement will be construed 
accordingly. 
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section allows a cash payment or other distribution to be made to or by a holder of 
Subordinated Notes as part of a Reclassification or as a result of a Reclassification.

Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP generally 
For the purposes of determining the Issue Date VWAP as described under Exchange, adjustments will be made in 
accordance with Adjustments to VWAP generally and Adjustments to VWAP for capital reconstruction  during the 
VWAP Period for the Issue Date VWAP. On and from the issue date, adjustments to the Issue Date VWAP: 
 
may be made by us in accordance with the conditions described below under Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for 
bonus issues, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP in certain circumstances (inclusive); 
 
if so made, will correspondingly cause an adjustment to the Maximum Exchange Number; and  
 
if so made, will be effective and binding on holders of Subordinated Notes under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be construed accordingly. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues 
Subject to the two paragraphs at the end of this section, if we make a pro-rata bonus issue of Ordinary Shares to holders of 
Ordinary Shares generally, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted immediately in accordance with the following formula: 
V = Vo x RD/(RD + RN) 
where: 
V means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately after the application of this formula; 
Vo means the Issue Date VWAP applying immediately prior to the application of this formula; 
RD means the number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately prior to the allotment of new Ordinary Shares 
pursuant to the bonus issue; and 
RN means the number of Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the bonus issue. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the paragraph above does not apply to Ordinary Shares issued as part of a bonus share plan, 
employee or executive share plan, executive option plan, share top up plan, share purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment 
plan. 
For the purposes of this section, an issue will be regarded as a bonus issue notwithstanding that we do not make offers to some 
or all holders of Ordinary Shares with registered addresses outside Australia (or to whom an offer is otherwise subject to foreign 
securities laws), provided that in so doing we are not in contravention of the ASX Listing Rules. 
Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital reconstruction 
If, at any time after the issue date, there is a change to the number of Ordinary Shares on issue because of a Reclassification into 
a lesser or greater number, the Issue Date VWAP will be adjusted by multiplying the Issue Date VWAP applicable on the Business 
Day immediately before the date of any such Reclassification by the following formula: 
A 
B 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
53 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
where: 
A means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately before the Reclassification; and 
B means the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares on issue immediately after the Reclassification. 
No adjustment to Issue Date VWAP in certain circumstances 
Despite the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues and Adjustments to Issue Date 
VWAP for capital reconstruction, no adjustment will be made to the Issue Date VWAP where any such adjustment (rounded if 
applicable) would be less than 1% of the Issue Date VWAP then in effect. 
Announcement of adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
We will notify any adjustment to the Issue Date VWAP under the provisions described in Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP 
generally, Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for bonus issues  and Adjustments to Issue Date VWAP for capital 
reconstruction to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and the holders of Subordinated Notes within 10 Business Days of us 
determining the adjustment and the adjustment will be final and binding. 
Status and quotation of Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange will rank equally with all other fully paid Ordinary Shares provided that the 
rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares issued or arising from Exchange do not take effect until 5:00 p.m. (Sydney time) on the 
Exchange Date (or such other time required by APRA). 
We will use all reasonable endeavours to quote the Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange of the Subordinated Notes on ASX. 
Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder 
1. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and: 
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes has notified us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of 
Exchange, which notice may be given at any time on or after the issue date and prior to the Exchange Date;  
 
the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder; or  
 
we have not received (for any reason whether or not due to the fault of that holder of Subordinated Notes) any 
information required by it in accordance with the conditions of the Subordinated Notes so as to impede us issuing the 
Ordinary Shares to a holder of Subordinated Notes on the Exchange Date, 
then, subject to the provisions described in paragraph 2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below, on the Exchange Date, 
the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged are immediately and 
irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this Exchange where the 
holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section 
below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee may not be us or one of our 
Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares, the 
nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the relevant holder of 
Subordinated Notes (unless, because the holder of Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, the 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
54 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
nominee is deemed to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, in which case such issue shall occur as soon as practicable 
after the nominee ceases to be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder).  
Attributable Proceeds means the net proceeds of sale of Ordinary Shares attributable to the Subordinated Notes of 
the relevant holder of Subordinated Notes, or where the provisions described in paragraph 4 of this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder section below apply, the Depositary Participant, actually received after deducting any applicable brokerage, 
stamp duty and other taxes.  
Ineligible Subordinated Holder means a holder of Subordinated Notes who is prohibited or restricted by any 
applicable law or regulation in force in Australia (including but not limited to Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act, the 
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) of Australia, the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 (Cth) of 
Australia and Part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) of Australia) from being offered, holding or 
acquiring Ordinary Shares provided that if the relevant prohibition or restriction only applies to the holder of 
Subordinated Notes in respect of some of its Subordinated Notes, it shall only be treated as an Ineligible Subordinated 
Holder in respect of those Subordinated Notes and not in respect of the balance of its Subordinated Notes), and 
includes a Foreign Subordinated Holder. We will be entitled to treat a holder of Subordinated Notes as not being an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder unless the holder of Subordinated Notes has otherwise notified us after the issue date 
and prior to the Exchange Date. 
Foreign Subordinated Holder means: 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes whose address in the register is a place outside Australia; or 
 
a holder of Subordinated Notes who we believe may not be a resident of Australia and we are not satisfied 
that the laws of the country in which we believe the holder of Subordinated Notes is resident permit the 
offer of Ordinary Shares to, or holding or acquisition of Ordinary Shares by, the holder of Subordinated Notes 
(but we will not be bound to enquire into those laws), either unconditionally or after compliance with 
conditions which we, in our absolute discretion, regards as acceptable and not unduly onerous. 
2. 
If Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) of a holder of 
Subordinated Notes are required to be Exchanged and the holder of Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or a nominee 
for a common depository for any one or more Depositary (such Depositary or nominee for a common depository 
acting in such capacity as is specified in the rules and regulations of the relevant Depositary or Depositaries) then, on 
the Exchange Date, the rights of the holder of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares from us) in relation to such Subordinated Notes being Exchanged 
are immediately and irrevocably terminated and we will (subject to the provisions described in paragraph 6 in this 
Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section below) issue the Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee 
may not be us or one of our Related Entities) for no additional consideration on terms that they are dealt with in 
accordance with the provisions described in paragraphs 3 and 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section below.

3. 
Where Ordinary Shares are issued to one or more nominees in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 
2 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an 
Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above, each person who is for the time being shown in the records of the 
relevant Depositary or Depositaries as the holder of the corresponding Subordinated Notes immediately prior to 
Exchange (Depositary Participant, in which regard any certificate or other document issued by a Depositary as to the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of such Subordinated Notes standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive 
and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest error) may, no later than 30 days following the relevant 
Exchange Date (Depositary Cut-Off Date), provide to us and the relevant nominee: 
 
its name and address for entry into any register of title and receipt of any certificate or holding statement in 
respect of any Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange; 
 
the security account details of the holder of Subordinated Notes in CHESS or such other account to which the 
Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange are to be credited; and 
 
such other information as is reasonably requested by us, 
and, if it does so, the nominee will transfer the relevant Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant as soon as 
possible thereafter. 
4. 
If a Depositary Participant: 
 
fails to provide the information required by the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange 
where the holder of Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder section above by the Depositary Cut-off Date; 
 
notifies us that it does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares on or prior to the Depositary Cut-off Date; or 
 
would be an Ineligible Subordinated Holder if the Depositary Participants name had been entered in a 
register as the owner of the Subordinated Notes immediately prior to Exchange, 
then, with effect from the Depositary Cut-off Date, the Depositary Participant will cease to be entitled to receive the 
relevant Ordinary Shares and, at the first opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares after the Depositary Cut-off Date, the 
relevant nominee will arrange for their sale at market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the Depositary 
Participant. 
5. 
Where a nominee is to be issued with Ordinary Shares under the provisions described in this section, on and from the 
date of issue of those Ordinary Shares, the relevant Subordinated Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) are taken to have been Exchanged and the only rights of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or the Depositary Participant (as the case may be) in respect of such Subordinated Notes (or 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) are:  
 
where the provisions described in paragraphs 1 or 4 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated 
Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above 
applies, to require the nominee to pay it the Attributable Proceeds; or  
 
where the provisions described in paragraph 3 in this Exchange where the holder of Subordinated Notes 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder section above applies and 
the Depositary Participant complies with the conditions set forth in that paragraph, to require the nominee 
to effect a transfer of those Ordinary Shares to the Depositary Participant.

6. 
If, where the provisions described in this section apply: 
 
the Exchange fails to take effect; and 
 
we have not otherwise issued Ordinary Shares to the relevant nominee within five Business Days after the 
date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, 
then the rights of the holders of Subordinated Notes (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and 
interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) are immediately and irrevocably terminated as described in Automatic 
Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  No further rights if Exchange cannot 
occur above. 
Exchange of a percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount  
If, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is necessary to Exchange a 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount, the provisions described in this section  Exchange Mechanics will apply to 
the Exchange as if references to the Outstanding Principal Amount were references to the relevant percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount to be Exchanged. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if, under the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section, it is not 
necessary to Exchange all of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, and either (a) a holder of 
Subordinated Notes is a Depositary or nominee for a common depository for any one or more Depositaries or (b) an Exchange of 
some only of the Subordinated Notes could result in the Exchange being applied among holders of Subordinated Notes or 
Depositary Participants (as applicable) other than on a pro-rata basis, the Exchange will be effected by the relevant percentage 
of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note being Exchanged. 
Holder of Subordinated Notes acknowledgements  
Each holder of Subordinated Notes irrevocably:  
 
consents to becoming a member of CBA upon Exchange of the Subordinated Notes as required by the conditions 
described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes section and agrees to be bound by our Constitution, in each 
case in respect of the Ordinary Shares issued to such holder of Subordinated Notes on Exchange;  
 
unless (x) it has given notice in accordance with the provisions described in  Exchange where the holder of 
Subordinated Notes does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder above that it 
does not wish to receive Ordinary Shares as a result of the Exchange or (y) it is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder, 
acknowledges and agrees that it is obliged to accept Ordinary Shares if it holds Subordinated Notes that are required 
to be Exchanged as and when required by the conditions described in this Description of the Subordinated Notes 
section notwithstanding anything that might otherwise affect Exchange including: 
 
any change in our financial position since the issue of such Subordinated Notes; 
 
any disruption to the market or potential market for the Ordinary Shares or to capital markets generally;  
 
any breach by us of any obligation in connection with the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
any failure to or delay in exchange, conversion or write down of other Relevant Securities; and 
 
acknowledges and agrees that: 
 
it will not have any rights to vote in respect of any Exchange or Write Down; 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
57 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
it has no claim against us for any loss it may suffer arising in connection with any Exchange or Write Down;  
 
it has no rights to compensation from, or any other remedies against, us or any other member of the CBA 
Group on account of the failure of us to issue Ordinary Shares if we are for any reason prevented from doing 
so;  
 
Exchange is not subject to any conditions other than those expressly provided for in Automatic Exchange 
or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event and this Exchange Mechanics 
section; and 
 
it has no right to request Exchange or to determine whether (or in what circumstances) the Subordinated 
Notes it holds are Exchanged. 
Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase  
Each Subordinated Note will be redeemed on the maturity date for its Outstanding Principal Amount unless we have previously 
conducted a Subordinated Note Repurchase or Subordinated Note Redemption or Exchanged or Written Down the 
Subordinated Notes in full. 
APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase 
A Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase may only occur before the maturity date if APRA has given 
its prior written approval to the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. Approval is at the discretion 
of APRA. Holders of Subordinated Notes should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for a Subordinated Note 
Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase. 
Additionally, we may only conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase before the maturity date 
if either:  
 
before or concurrently with the Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase we replace the 
Subordinated Notes with a capital instrument which is of the same or better quality (for the purposes of APRAs 
prudential standards as they are applied to the CBA Group at the relevant time) than the Subordinated Notes and the 
replacement of the Subordinated Notes is done under conditions that are sustainable for the income capacity of CBA; 
or 
 
we obtain confirmation from APRA that APRA is satisfied, having regard to the capital position of the CBA Level 1 
Group and the CBA Level 2 Group, that we do not have to replace the Subordinated Notes.  
Redemption of Subordinated Notes under certain circumstances 
No Subordinated Note or portion thereof can, or will, be redeemed at the option of a holder of such Subordinated Note. 
As described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or Subordinated Note Repurchase, 
we may redeem prior to the maturity date in whole but not in part, the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note 
Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events or regulatory events, as described below.  
Any Subordinated Note Redemption as described below under Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of 
certain tax events and Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events will be made at 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, which shall be equal to 100% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes redeemed pursuant to the Subordinated Note Redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but 
excluding) the Subordinated Note Redemption Date. If we have provided a notice of Subordinated Note Redemption, the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes called for Subordinated Note Redemption shall become due on the 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
58 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Subordinated Note Redemption Date. On and after the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, unless we default in payment of 
the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, interest shall cease to accrue on the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes. 
If we elect to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption, we will provide holders of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agent 
with at least 20 Business Days (and no more than 60 Business Days) irrevocable notice (for the avoidance of doubt, an 
Exchange under the Subordinated Notes takes priority over a notice for Subordinated Note Redemption). Notices of a 
Subordinated Note Redemption shall be given by us in writing and for so long as any Subordinated Notes are held by the 
Depositary, given to each holder in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Depositary relating to the delivery of 
notices, or mailed to their last addresses appearing on the register of the Subordinated Notes. Notices of a Subordinated Note 
Redemption shall specify the Subordinated Note Redemption Date, the Subordinated Note Early Redemption Amount, the place 
or places of payment and that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Subordinated Notes which are the 
subject of the Subordinated Note Redemption.  
All Subordinated Notes which are the subject of a Subordinated Note Redemption will be cancelled forthwith and all our 
liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged.  
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain tax events  
Subject to the requirements described above under APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we receive an opinion from reputable legal counsel or other 
tax adviser in Australia, experienced in such matters, to the effect that there is a material risk that as a result of a change in laws 
of Australia (including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment which has been or will be 
introduced), we would be exposed to a more than de minimis adverse tax consequence in relation to the Subordinated Notes 
other than a tax consequence we expected as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected as at the date 
of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Tax Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of the Subordinated 
Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date. 
If we choose to redeem the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a 
Tax Event, then immediately prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption of Subordinated Notes pursuant 
to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated 
Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right 
to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which we would be subject to the adverse tax consequence. Such notice 
shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note Redemption have occurred and state that we have 
elected to exercise our option to conduct the Subordinated Note Redemption in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated 
Notes. 
Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, if, at any time after the issue date, we determine that as a result of a change in the laws of 
Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards (including following any announcement of a prospective change or 
amendment which has been or will be introduced) all, some or a percentage of all or some Subordinated Notes are not or will 
not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the CBA Group under APRAs prudential standards (as amended from time to time), other 
than as a result of a change of treatment expected by us as at the issue date (and, in the case of any successor entity, expected 
as at the date of that entitys assumption of our obligations) (a Regulatory Event), then we may redeem all (but not some) of 
the Subordinated Notes pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption at any time prior to the maturity date.  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
59 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If we choose to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption upon the occurrence of such a Regulatory Event, then immediately 
prior to the giving of any notice of Subordinated Note Redemption pursuant to this section, we must deliver to the Fiscal Agent 
an officers certificate stating that we are entitled to effect such Subordinated Note Redemption and setting forth in reasonable 
detail a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to our right to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption have 
occurred. 
The notice of such Subordinated Note Redemption must not be given earlier than 60 Business Days before the interest payment 
date occurring immediately before the earliest date on which all, some or a percentage of all or some of the Subordinated Notes 
will cease to be treated as Tier 2 Capital. Such notice shall also state that the conditions precedent to such Subordinated Note 
Redemption have occurred and state that we have elected to exercise our option to conduct a Subordinated Note Redemption 
in accordance with the terms of the Subordinated Notes. 
Subordinated Note Repurchase 
Subject to the requirements described above under  APRA approval required for Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Subordinated Note Repurchase, we or any member of the CBA Group may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and 
regulations, at any time purchase Subordinated Notes in the open market, by tender to all or some of the holders of 
Subordinated Notes or by private agreement or otherwise at any price (Subordinated Note Repurchase). All Subordinated 
Notes repurchased by us or any member of the CBA Group as a result of a Subordinated Note Repurchase will be cancelled 
forthwith and all our liabilities and obligations in connection with those Subordinated Notes will be discharged. 
Mergers and similar transactions 
We are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another person. We are also permitted to sell substantially all of our 
assets to another person, or to buy substantially all of the assets of another person.  
However, we may not take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met: 
 
where we merge out of existence or sell our assets, except as otherwise indicated below, the other person must be an 
entity organized as a corporation, trust or partnership, it must expressly assume the due and punctual payment of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of and interest, if any, on the Subordinated Notes and the performance of every 
covenant included in the Subordinated Notes; 
 
we deliver to the holders of the Subordinated Notes an officers certificate and opinion of counsel, each stating that 
the consolidation, merger, sale, lease or purchase of assets complies with the terms of the Subordinated Notes; and 
 
the merger, sale of assets or other transaction must not cause a default on the Subordinated Notes, and we must not 
already be in default under the Subordinated Notes, unless the merger or other transaction would cure the default. 
If such person is not organized and validly existing under the laws of Australia, it must expressly agree: 
 
to indemnify the holder of the Subordinated Notes against any tax, assessment or governmental charge required to be 
withheld or deducted from any payment to such holder as a consequence of such merger, sale of assets or other 
transaction, provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any deduction or withholding imposed or 
required pursuant to Section 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official 
interpretations thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or 
regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code, and shall not require the payment of additional 
amounts on account of any such withholding or deduction); and 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
60 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
that all payments pursuant to the Subordinated Notes must be made without withholding or deduction for or on 
account of any tax of whatever nature imposed or levied on behalf of the jurisdiction of organization of such person, 
or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, unless such tax is required by such jurisdiction or any 
such subdivision or authority to be withheld or deducted, in which case such person will pay such additional amounts 
in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Subordinated Notes after such withholding or deduction 
will equal the amount which would have been received in respect of the Subordinated Notes in the absence of such 
withholding or deduction, subject to the same exceptions as would apply with respect to the payment by us of 
additional amounts in respect of the Subordinated Notes (substituting the jurisdiction of organization of such person 
for Australia). 
Upon any such consolidation or merger, or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Issuer 
substantially as an entirety in accordance with the provisions described in this Mergers and similar transactions section 
above, the successor person formed by such consolidation or into which we are merged or to which such conveyance, transfer 
or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, us under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes with the same effect as if the successor person had been named as the Issuer therein 
and herein and thereafter, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor person shall be relieved of all obligations and 
covenants under the Subordinated Notes and under the Fiscal Agency Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the above, the terms of the Subordinated Notes do not prevent us from consolidating with or merging into any 
other person or conveying, transferring or leasing our respective properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any 
person, or from permitting any person to consolidate with or merge into us or to convey, transfer or lease our respective 
properties and assets substantially as an entirety to us where such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease is: 
 
required by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) under law and prudential regulation 
applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia (including, without limitation, the Australian Banking Act or the 
Australian FSBT Act, as used herein, and any amendments thereto, rules thereunder and any successor laws, 
amendments and rules); or  
 
determined by us or by APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official appointed by it) to be necessary in order for 
us to be managed in a sound and prudent manner or for us or APRA (or any statutory manager or similar official 
appointed by it) to resolve any financial difficulties affecting us, in each case in accordance with law and prudential 
regulation applicable in the Commonwealth of Australia. 
It is possible that the merger, sale of assets or other transaction would cause some of our property to become subject to a 
mortgage or other legal mechanism giving lenders preferential rights in that property over other lenders or over our general 
creditors if we fail to pay them back.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Payment of additional amounts  
We will pay all amounts that we are required to pay on the Subordinated Notes without withholding or deduction for, or on 
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed or levied by or on behalf of 
Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. This obligation will not apply, however, if those taxes, 
duties, assessments or other governmental charges are required by Australia or any such subdivision or taxing authority to be 
withheld or deducted (including withholding or deduction required pursuant to an agreement described in section 1471(b) of 
the Code). If that were to occur, we will pay additional amounts of, or in respect of, the principal of, and any premium and 
interest on, the affected Subordinated Notes (additional amounts) that are necessary so that the net amounts paid to the 
holders of those Subordinated Notes, after deduction or withholding, will equal the amounts of principal and any premium and 
interest that we would have had to pay on those Subordinated Notes if the deduction or withholding had not been required 
except that our obligation to pay additional amounts in relation to the Subordinated Notes will not apply to: 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed 
but for the fact that the holder of the affected Subordinated Note: 
 
was a resident, domiciliary or national of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment 
or was physically present in, Australia or otherwise had some connection with Australia other than only 
owning that Subordinated Note, or receiving payments under that Subordinated Note; 
 
presented that Subordinated Note for payment in Australia, unless he or she was required to present that 
Subordinated Note for payment and it could not have been presented for payment anywhere else; or 
 
presented that Subordinated Note more than 30 days after the date payment became due on that 
Subordinated Note or was provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the holder would have 
been entitled to the additional amounts on presenting the Subordinated Note for payment on any day during 
that 30 day period;  
 
any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge 
or any withholding or deduction on account of those taxes; 
 
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from 
payments of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on the affected Subordinated Note; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
holder or the beneficial owner of the affected Subordinated Note did not comply with our request: 
 
to provide information concerning his or her nationality, residence or identity; or 
 
to make a declaration or other similar claim or satisfy any requirement for information or reporting, 
which, in the case of each of the two preceding bullet points, is required or imposed by a statute, treaty, regulation or 
administrative practice of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in Australia as a condition to an 
exemption from all or part of the withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because the 
person who receives the payment is our associate as defined in section 128F of the Australian Tax Act; 
 
any withholding, deduction, tax, duties, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by 
reason of the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia giving a notice under Section 255 of the 
Australian Tax Act or Section 260-5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 of the Commonwealth of 
Australia; 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
62 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
any withholding or deduction due to a determination having been made under Part IVA of the Australian Tax Act (or 
any modification thereof or provision substituted therefor) by the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of 
Australia that withholding tax is payable in respect of a payment in circumstances where that payment would not have 
been subject to withholding tax because of a scheme which had the dominant purpose of causing the payment not to 
be subject to withholding tax;  
 
any withholding or deduction that is imposed by reason of the failure of a person entitled to such payment to perfect 
an exemption from any withholding or deduction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of any payment 
being made through an intermediary that is subject to withholding or deduction) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 
through 1474 of the Code and any regulations or agreements thereunder or official interpretations thereof; or 
 
any combination of the foregoing bullet points.  
The term associate is widely defined for the purposes of section 128F of the Australian Tax Act. It would include: 
 
a person who controls a majority voting interest in us or is able to sufficiently influence us; 
 
any trust under which we, or any of our subsidiaries, can benefit; and 
 
any entity which we can sufficiently influence or in which we have a majority voting interest, even where that entity 
acts as trustee. 
No additional amounts shall be payable with respect to any payment of, or in respect of, the Outstanding Principal Amount of, 
or any interest on, any Subordinated Note to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner 
of such payment to the extent that payment would, under the laws of Australia or any political subdivision or taxing authority of 
Australia, be treated as being derived or received for tax purposes by a beneficiary or settlor of that fiduciary or a member of 
that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to those additional amounts had it been the actual 
holder of the affected Subordinated Note. 
In addition, any amounts to be paid on the Subordinated Notes will be paid, and any Ordinary Shares to be delivered as a result 
of an Exchange of such Subordinated Notes will be delivered, net of any deduction, withholding, interest or penalty imposed or 
required pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations or official interpretations 
thereof, any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or 
practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such 
Sections of the Code (a FATCA Withholding), and no additional amounts will be required to be paid and no additional Ordinary 
Shares will be required to be delivered on account of any such FATCA Withholding. Each holder shall be deemed to authorize us 
to remit, or otherwise deal with, any amounts and Ordinary Shares comprising a FATCA Withholding and report information in 
accordance with applicable requirements connected therewith. 
Whenever we refer in this document, in any context, to the payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount of or interest on any 
Subordinated Note or the net proceeds received on the sale or Exchange of any Subordinated Note, we mean to include the 
payment of additional amounts to the extent that, in that context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable. 
Any additional amounts payable on Subordinated Notes will be subordinated in right of payment, see  Status of Subordinated 
Notes above. 
Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange 
We may, without the consent of the holders of the Subordinated Notes, provided that the Substitution Conditions (as defined 
below) are satisfied, by giving notice to the Depositary, Fiscal Agent and holders of the Subordinated Notes, substitute for 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
63 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
ourself a non-operating holding company within the meaning of the Australian Banking Act (NOHC) as the issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (Successor). 
The notice shall specify the date on which the substitution is to take effect (the Date of Substitution).  
Substitution Conditions 
The Substitution Conditions are: 
 
by entering into a deed poll and such other documents (if any) as may be necessary to give full effect to the 
substitution (the Successor Documents), the Successor agrees with effect on and from the Date of Substitution, to 
deliver NOHC Ordinary Shares under all circumstances when we would otherwise have been required to deliver 
Ordinary Shares, subject to the same terms and conditions as set out in the Subordinated Notes (with all necessary 
modifications);  
 
unless otherwise approved by APRA in writing, the Successor agrees that in all circumstances where the Successor 
delivers fully paid NOHC Ordinary Shares under the Successor Documents, the Successor or another entity (which is a 
parent entity) will simultaneously subscribe for Ordinary Shares in such amount as may be necessary to ensure that 
the capital position of our Level 1 Group and our Level 2 Group is equivalent to the position if such Successor 
Documents had not been entered into and we were required to issue the Ordinary Shares; 
 
the NOHC Ordinary Shares are or are to be quoted on ASX, and the Successor agrees to use all reasonable endeavours 
and furnish all such documents, information and undertakings as may be reasonably necessary in order to procure 
quotation of NOHC Ordinary Shares issued under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes on the securities 
exchanges on which the NOHC Ordinary Shares are quoted at the time of delivery; 
 
both we and the Successor have obtained APRA approval and all other necessary authorizations, regulatory and 
governmental approvals and consents for such substitution and for the performance by the Successor of its obligations 
under the Subordinated Notes and the documents effecting substitution; 
 
if the Successor does not have a place of business in New York, the Successor has appointed a process agent in New 
York to receive service of process on its behalf in relation to any legal proceedings arising out of or in connection with 
the Subordinated Notes;  
 
the Successor has, in our reasonable opinion, the financial capacity to satisfy its obligations under the Subordinated 
Notes;  
 
we have used all reasonable endeavours to give an irrevocable notice to the holders of the Subordinated Notes as 
soon as practicable before the Board initiates a restructure of the CBA Group and a NOHC becomes our ultimate 
holding company (a NOHC Event), but no later than 10 Business Days before the NOHC Event occurs, specifying the 
amendments to the Subordinated Notes which will be made under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes 
in connection with the substitution of a NOHC as the issuer of Ordinary Shares on Exchange and such amended terms 
will have effect on and from the date specified in the notice; and 
 
the Successor will not be deemed to be an investment company required to register under the U.S. Investment 
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Effect of substitution of Successor 
If the relevant requirements set out in Substitution Conditions have been completed, on and from the Date of Substitution: 
 
we (or any corporation which has previously assumed our obligations) will be released from any obligation we would 
otherwise have under the conditions described in the Subordinated Notes to issue Ordinary Shares to holders of the 
Subordinated Notes upon Exchange; and 
 
references to Ordinary Shares in the Subordinated Notes (other than the reference contained in the first two bullets 
under Substitution Conditions and in the definitions of Issue Date VWAP and VWAP Period (to the extent the 
reference applies to Issue Date VWAP only)) and the Terms Agreement will be taken to be references to the NOHC 
Ordinary Shares.  
Default, remedies and waiver of default  
Subordinated Note events of default 
A Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes if: 
(A) 
we fail to pay any amount due in respect of the Subordinated Notes and such default continues for a period of 15 
Business Days and is continuing, provided that no Subordinated Note Event of Default shall arise on account of any 
non-payment if we withhold, deduct or refuse to make the payment:  
 
in order to comply with any law or regulation or with the order of any court of competent jurisdiction, in 
each case applicable to such payment; or 
 
in case of doubt as to the validity or applicability of any such law, regulation or order, in accordance with 
advice given as to such validity or applicability, at any time during the said period of 15 Business Days, by 
independent legal advisers;  
 
to the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would not be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the Holder of Subordinated Notes); or 
(B) 
an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order successfully appealed or permanently 
stayed within 30 Business Days), or an effective resolution is passed, for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not 
elsewhere).  
Consequences of a Subordinated Note Event of Default 
If a Subordinated Note Event of Default occurs in relation to the Subordinated Notes: 
 
as described under paragraph (A) of Subordinated Note events of default above, any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may institute proceedings: 
 
to recover the amount we have failed to pay, provided that we may only be compelled to pay that amount to 
the extent that, immediately after the payment, we would be Solvent (in which case such amount still 
accumulates without compounding and remains a debt owing by us to the holder of the Subordinated 
Notes); 
 
for specific performance of any other obligation in respect of the Subordinated Notes; or 
 
for our Winding-Up in Australia (but not elsewhere); or 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
65 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
 
as described under paragraph (B) Subordinated Note events of default above, the Subordinated Notes are 
immediately due and payable for an amount equal to the Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid 
interest up to (but excluding) the date of commencement of our Winding-Up and any holder of Subordinated Notes 
may, subject to the provisions described in How the Subordinated Notes rank against other debt, prove in our 
Winding-Up in respect of this amount. 
A holder of Subordinated Notes has no right to accelerate payment or exercise any other remedies (including any right to sue for 
damages) as a consequence of any Subordinated Note Event of Default other than as set out in this section.  
Modification of the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement and waiver of covenants  
The prior written approval of APRA is required to modify, amend or supplement the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, or to give consents or waivers in respect of the 
Subordinated Notes or take other actions where such modification, amendment, supplement, consent, waiver or other action 
may affect the eligibility of the Subordinated Notes as Tier 2 Capital of CBA (including, for the avoidance of doubt, waivers of any 
of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as they affect the Subordinated Notes, or in the Subordinated Notes).  
If we are able to obtain APRAs prior written approval, there are three types of changes we can make to the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement and the Subordinated Notes and these changes might subject the holders to U.S. federal tax.  
Changes requiring each holders approval 
First, there are changes that cannot be made without the consent or the affirmative vote or approval of each holder affected by 
the change. Here is a list of those types of changes: 
 
change to due date for the payment of Outstanding Principal Amount of, or any installment of interest on any 
Subordinated Note; 
 
reduce the Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated Note, the portion of any Outstanding Principal Amount 
that is payable upon acceleration of the maturity of the Subordinated Note, the interest rate or the Subordinated Note 
Early Redemption Amount, except as expressly provided in the terms of the Subordinated Notes; 
 
changes to the subordination provisions of a Subordinated Note in a manner adverse to the interests of any holder of 
the Subordinated Note; 
 
change the currency of any payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
change our obligation to pay additional amounts;  
 
change the place of payment on a Subordinated Note;  
 
reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes necessary to modify, amend or 
supplement the Fiscal Agency Agreement or the Subordinated Notes or to waive past defaults or future compliance; or 
 
reduce the percentage of Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes required to adopt a resolution or 
the required quorum at any meeting of holders of Subordinated Notes at which a resolution is adopted. 
Changes not requiring approval  
The second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the Subordinated Notes. We may, without the vote or 
consent or affirmative vote or approval of any holder of Subordinated Notes, amend the terms of the Subordinated Notes or the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, if we are of the opinion that such alteration is: (i) of a 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
66 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
formal, technical or minor nature; (ii) made to cure any ambiguity or correct any manifest error; (iii) necessary or expedient for 
the purposes of facilitating a substitution under the terms described in Substitution of a NOHC for us as issuer of the 
Ordinary Shares on Exchange (including satisfying any requirement of APRA in connection with such a substitution); (iv) made 
to amend any date or time period stated, required or permitted in connection with any Subordinated Note Redemption or 
Exchange (including, without limitation, when the proceeds of a Subordinated Note Redemption are to be reinvested in a new 
security to be issued by us or a Related Body Corporate); (v) not materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated 
Notes as a whole (subject to the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval); or (vi) made to (subject to 
the terms described in Changes requiring each holders approval) (x) alter the terms of any Subordinated Notes to align 
them with any Relevant Tier 2 Securities issued after the date of such Subordinated Notes; or (y) alter either or both of the 
definitions of Relevant Tier 1 Securities and Relevant Tier 2 Securities on account of the issue (after the date of issue of any 
Subordinated Notes) of capital instruments of the CBA Group, provided in each case of (vi)(x) and (vi)(y) such alteration is not 
materially prejudicial to the interests of holders of Subordinated Notes as a whole.   
Changes requiring majority approval 
Any other change to the Subordinated Notes or the Fiscal Agency Agreement, insofar as it affects the Subordinated Notes, 
requires the following (in addition to the prior written approval of APRA):  
 
the written consent of the holders of at least 50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes 
affected by such change; or 
 
the adoption of a resolution at a meeting at which a quorum of holders of Subordinated Notes is present by at least 
50% of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes affected by such change represented at the 
meeting. 
The same 50% approval would be required for us to obtain a waiver of any of our covenants in the Fiscal Agency Agreement or 
the Subordinated Notes. Such covenants include the promises we make about merging, which we describe above under  
Mergers and similar transactions. If the holders approve a waiver of a covenant, we will not have to comply with it. 
If approved in accordance with the terms described in this section, then all holders of Subordinated Notes, including holders 
who did not provide their written consent or attend and vote at a relevant meeting and holders who voted in a manner contrary 
to the majority, will be bound by such change. 
The quorum at any meeting called to adopt a resolution will be persons holding or representing a majority in Outstanding 
Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes and, at any reconvened meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum, 25% of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of the Subordinated Notes. For purposes of determining whether holders of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of Subordinated Notes required for any action or vote, or for any quorum, have taken the action or vote, or 
constitute a quorum, the Outstanding Principal Amount of any particular Subordinated Note may differ from its Outstanding 
Principal Amount at the maturity date but will not exceed its stated face amount upon original issuance. 
Unless otherwise indicated, we will be entitled to set any day as a record date for determining which holders of book-entry 
Subordinated Notes are entitled to make, take or give requests, demands, authorizations, directions, notices, consents, waivers 
or other action, or to vote on actions, authorized or permitted by the Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes. In 
addition, record dates for any book-entry Subordinated Note may be set in accordance with procedures established by the 
Depositary from time to time. Therefore, record dates for book-entry Subordinated Notes may differ from those for other 
Subordinated Notes. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how 
approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the Fiscal Agency Agreement or any Subordinated Notes or request a 
waiver.

Only outstanding Subordinated Notes are eligible 
Only holders of outstanding Subordinated Notes will be eligible to participate in any action by holders of Subordinated Notes. 
Also, we will count only outstanding Subordinated Notes in determining whether the various percentage requirements for 
taking action have been met. For these purposes, a Subordinated Note will not be outstanding: 
 
if it has been surrendered for cancellation;  
 
to the extent it has been Written Down; 
 
if we have called such Subordinated Note for a Subordinated Note Redemption or it has become due and payable at 
maturity or otherwise and we have deposited or set aside, in trust for its holder, money for its payment or 
Subordinated Note Redemption;  
 
if it is in lieu of or in substitution for other Subordinated Notes that have been authenticated and delivered; 
 
if we are the direct or indirect owner; or  
 
if it has been Exchanged.  
Form, exchange and transfer of Subordinated Notes 
If any Subordinated Notes cease to be issued in registered global form, they will be issued:  
 
only in fully registered form;  
 
without interest coupons; and  
 
unless we indicate otherwise, in denominations of US$200,000 or integral multiple of US$1,000 in excess thereof. 
Holders may exchange their Subordinated Notes for Subordinated Notes of smaller denominations or combine them into fewer 
Subordinated Notes of larger denominations, as long as the total Outstanding Principal Amount is not changed.  
Holders may exchange or transfer their Subordinated Notes at the office of the Fiscal Agent. They may also replace lost, stolen, 
destroyed or mutilated Subordinated Notes at that office. We have appointed the Fiscal Agent to act as our agent for registering 
Subordinated Notes in the names of holders and transferring and replacing Subordinated Notes. We may appoint another entity 
to perform these functions or perform them ourselves. 
Holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their Subordinated Notes, but they may be required 
to pay for any tax or other governmental charge associated with the exchange or transfer. The transfer or exchange, and any 
replacement, will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holders proof of legal ownership. The transfer agent 
may require an indemnity before replacing any Subordinated Notes. 
We may appoint additional transfer agents or cancel the appointment of any particular transfer agent. We may also approve a 
change in the office through which any transfer agent acts. 
If any Subordinated Notes are redeemable pursuant to a Subordinated Note Redemption and we redeem less than all those 
Subordinated Notes, we may block the transfer or exchange of those Subordinated Notes during the period beginning 15 days 
before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing, in order to freeze the list of holders to 
prepare the mailing, and refuse to register transfers of or exchange any Subordinated Note selected for redemption, except that 
we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any Subordinated Note being partially 
redeemed. 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
68 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
If a Subordinated Note is issued as a Global Note, only the Depositary  i.e., DTC  will be entitled to transfer and exchange the 
Subordinated Note as described in this subsection, since the Depositary will be the sole holder of the Subordinated Note. 
The rules for exchange described above apply to exchange of Subordinated Notes for other Subordinated Notes of the same 
kind.  
Payment mechanics for Subordinated Notes 
Who receives payment? 
If interest is due on a Subordinated Note on an interest payment date, we will pay the interest to the person in whose name the 
Subordinated Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date relating to the interest payment date, see 
 Payment of interest below. If interest is due at the maturity date, we will pay the interest to the person entitled to receive 
the principal of the Subordinated Note. If principal or another amount besides interest is due on a Subordinated Note at the 
maturity date, we will pay the amount to the holder of the Subordinated Note against surrender of the Subordinated Note at a 
proper place of payment or, in the case of a Global Note, in accordance with the applicable policies of the Depositary, which will 
be DTC. 
Payment of interest 
For each interest payment date, the interest to be paid in arrears to (but excluding) the interest payment date shall be that 
which has accrued from (and including) the prior interest payment date. Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year 
comprised of twelve 30-day calendar months. If any interest payment date for the Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a 
Business Day, the interest payment shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment 
shall accrue for the period from and after the interest payment date. If the maturity date or any earlier Redemption Date falls on 
a day that is not a Business Day, payment of the Outstanding Principal Amount and interest otherwise due on such day will be 
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such 
maturity date, or Redemption Date, as the case may be. 
No interest will accrue on any Subordinated Notes, or relevant percentage of Subordinated Notes, required to be Exchanged in 
the period from (and including) the interest payment date that immediately precedes the Exchange Date or (in the case where 
Subordinated Notes are Written Down) the Write Down Date to the Exchange Date or Write Down Date, as applicable.   
How we will make payments on Global Notes  
We will make payments on a Global Note in accordance with the applicable policies as in effect from time to time of the 
Depositary, which will be DTC. Under those policies, we will pay directly to the Depositary, or its nominee, and not to any 
indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the Global Note. An indirect owners right to receive those payments will be 
governed by the rules and practices of the Depositary and its participants. 
Paying Agent 
We may appoint one or more financial institutions to act as our paying agents, at whose designated offices Subordinated Notes 
in non-global entry form may be surrendered for payment at their maturity. We call each of those financial institutions a Paying 
Agent. We may add, replace or terminate Paying Agents from time to time; provided that at all times there will be a Paying 
Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. We may also choose to act as our own Paying Agent. Initially, we 
have appointed The Bank of New York Mellon, as the Paying Agent. We must notify the Fiscal Agent of changes in the Paying 
Agents.  
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
 
69 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Unclaimed payments 
Regardless of who acts as Paying Agent, all money paid by us to a Paying Agent that remains unclaimed at the end of two years 
after the amount is due to a holder will be repaid to us. After that two-year period, the holder may look only to us for payment 
and not to the Fiscal Agent, any other Paying Agent or anyone else. 
Notices 
Notices to be given to holders of a Global Note will be given only to the Depositary, in accordance with its applicable policies as 
in effect from time to time. Notices to be given to holders of Subordinated Notes not in global form will be sent by mail to the 
respective addresses of the holders as they appear in the Fiscal Agents records, and will be deemed given when mailed. Neither 
the failure to give any notice to a particular holder, nor any defect in a notice given to a particular holder, will affect the 
sufficiency of any notice given to another holder. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for 
information on how they will receive notices. 
Nothing in the above paragraph affects the Exchange or Write Down of the Subordinated Notes as described under  
Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event  Exchange. 
Our relationship with the Fiscal Agent 
The Bank of New York Mellon is serving as the Fiscal Agent for the Subordinated Notes issued under the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement. The Bank of New York Mellon has provided services for us and our affiliates in the past and may do so in the future. 
Among other things, The Bank of New York Mellon serves as fiscal agent with regard to some of our other debt obligations. 
Successor fiscal agent 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that the Fiscal Agent may be removed by us at any time or may resign upon 30 days prior 
written notice to us or any shorter period that we accept, effective upon the acceptance by a successor fiscal agent of its 
appointment. The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that any successor fiscal agent must have an established place of business 
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and a combined capital and surplus in excess of US$50,000,000. We must 
notify the holders of the Subordinated Notes of the appointment of a successor fiscal agent. 
Governing law 
The Fiscal Agency Agreement and the Subordinated Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of 
the State of New York without reference to the State of New York principles regarding conflicts of laws, except that all matters 
governing authorization and execution of the Subordinated Notes and the Fiscal Agency Agreement by us, the subordination 
provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Status and Subordination of Subordinated Notes above, the Exchange 
and Write Down provisions of the Subordinated Notes described under Automatic Exchange or Write Down upon the 
occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event above and the substitution provisions described above under Substitution of a 
NOHC for us as issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law 
applying in New South Wales, Australia. We have appointed the General Manager, Americas, of our New York branch, located at 
599 Lexington Avenue, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10022, as our agent for service of process in The City of New York in 
connection with any action arising out of the sale of the Subordinated Notes or enforcement of the terms of the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement.

Schedule 2  Rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares may be issued to a holder of Subordinated Notes by way of Exchange. Ordinary Shares may also be 
issued to a nominee to hold for sale for the benefit of a holder of Subordinated Notes if Exchange occurs and the 
holder of Subordinated Notes has notified CBA that they do not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or the holder of 
Subordinated Notes is an Ineligible Subordinated Holder. 
The rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares are set out in the constitution of CBA, which is dated 13 
November 2008, and incorporates amendments up to and including all amendments passed at the Annual General 
Meeting on 13 November 2008 (Constitution). The Constitution provides for the following: 
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Any Ordinary Shares issued to a holder of Subordinated Notes by way of Exchange will be fully paid and will rank 
equally with Ordinary Shares already on issue in all respects. 
Transfers 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, transfers of Ordinary Shares are not effective until registered. 
Ordinary Shares are transferable, subject to the ASX Listing Rules, ASX Settlement Operating Rules and the 
Constitution, and the right of the directors of CBA to refuse to register a transfer of Ordinary Shares in limited 
circumstances. 
Unless otherwise required by law or the Constitution, CBA is entitled to treat the registered holder as the absolute 
owner of a share. Ordinary Shares held by a trustee may, with the directors consent, be identified as being subject to 
the relevant trust. 
Except in limited circumstances, CBA is not bound to register more than three persons as joint holders of an Ordinary 
Share. If CBA is required to issue a share certificate for a share by law or the ASX Listing Rules, CBA is not required 
to issue more than one certificate. 
Restrictions apply in respect of persons who become entitled to Ordinary Shares by reason of a holders death or 
bankruptcy. In the case of the death of a holder, the survivor or survivors jointly registered as holders and the legal 
personal representatives of a sole holder are the only persons CBA will recognise as having title to the holders 
interest in the shares. 
Dividends 
Holders of Ordinary Shares may receive dividends if the directors determine that a dividend is payable. CBA may not 
pay a dividend unless CBAs assets exceed its liabilities, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the 
shareholders of CBA as a whole and the payment does not materially prejudice the ability of CBA to pay its creditors. 
Payment may also be subject to the rights of holders of securities carrying preferred rights. CBA pays holders with 
registered addresses in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom cash dividends by direct credit. If a direct 
credit payment instruction is not provided, the dividend will be held in a non-interest bearing account. CBA also has a 
dividend reinvestment plan for eligible holders. The directors of CBA determine whether or not the dividend 
reinvestment plan operates for each dividend and their decision is announced to ASX. 
Winding up 
On winding up of CBA, holders of Ordinary Shares will participate in the division of any surplus assets of CBA (subject 
to the rights of holders of shares carrying preferred rights).

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 159/2019 
 
 
Meetings 
Holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive notice of, attend and, subject to the Constitution, to vote in person, 
by representative, attorney or proxy at general meetings of CBA. 
On a show of hands, each holder (regardless of the number of shares held) has one vote. On a poll, each holder has 
one vote for each fully paid Ordinary Share held. 
Issue of further shares 
The directors of CBA control the issue of shares. Subject to the Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rules, the directors 
may issue further shares, and grant rights or options over shares, on such terms as they think fit. 
Restrictions of ownership of Ordinary Shares

right of persons to hold, own or vote on Ordinary Shares. 
Variation of the Constitution

by members entitled to vote on the resolution) to vary the Constitution.

lodged with ASX on 12 September 2019. If approved, the amendments are not expected to impact materially the 
rights attaching to Ordinary Shares described above.

ASX announcement 
ISSUE OF AUD 100 MILLION WORTH OF 
SUBORDINATED NOTES 
Notice under section 708A(12H)(e) Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) 
23 September 2019: Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is pleased to confirm that today it will issue AUD 100 
million worth of subordinated notes. The AUD 100 million 3.66 percent subordinated notes due 2034 (Subordinated 
Notes) will be issued pursuant to CBAs U.S.$70,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme (EMTN 
Programme). Terms used but not defined in this announcement are defined in the information memorandum for the 
issue of the Subordinated Notes under the EMTN Programme dated 3 July 2019 (Information Memorandum). 
The Subordinated Notes potentially exchange into fully paid ordinary shares of CBA (Ordinary Shares) if a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs. 
This notice is a cleansing notice prepared for the purposes of section 708A(12H)(e) of the Corporations Act 2001 
(Cth) (Corporations Act) (as inserted by ASIC Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71). 
CBA has elected to give this notice to enable Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange to be sold without disclosure 
under Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act. This notice includes all the information investors and their professional 
advisers would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of: 
 
in Schedule 1, the rights and liabilities attaching to the Subordinated Notes that is based on the description in 
the Information Memorandum, as supplemented by the pricing supplement for the Subordinated Notes dated 
19 September 2019 (Pricing Supplement); and 
 
in Schedule 2, the rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares, 
in each case only to the extent to which it is reasonable for investors and their professional advisers to expect to find 
the information in this notice. 
CBA confirms that: 
(a) 
the Subordinated Notes were issued without disclosure to investors under Part 6D.2 of the Corporations Act; 
(b) 
the information in this notice remains current as at todays date; 
(c) 
this notice (including the schedules) complies with section 708A of the Corporations Act, as modified by ASIC 
Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71; and 
(d) 
this notice (including the schedules) has complied with section 708A(12I) of the Corporations Act as inserted 
by ASIC Corporations (Regulatory Capital Securities) Instrument 2016/71. 
Effect of the Subordinated Notes offer on CBA 
The issue of Subordinated Notes by CBA will not have a material impact on CBAs financial position. If a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event occurs and CBA issues Ordinary Shares, the impact of Exchange on CBA would be to increase CBAs 
shareholders equity. The number of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange is limited to the Maximum Exchange 
1 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019

Number. The Maximum Exchange Number is 31,351.89 Ordinary Shares per Subordinated Note (with a nominal 
value of A$500,000), based on the Issue Date VWAP of A$79.74 per Ordinary Share.  
Additional information 
CBA is a disclosing entity for the purposes of the Corporations Act and, as a result, is subject to regular reporting and 
disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act and the ASX Listing Rules. In addition, CBA must notify ASX 
immediately (subject to certain exceptions) if it becomes aware of information about CBA that a reasonable person 
would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of its securities including Ordinary Shares.

ISIN: 
XS2055108349 
Form: 
Each Subordinated Note will be: 
 
denominated in Australian dollars; 
 
registered on a register located in Luxembourg (Register); 
 
a debt obligation of the Issuer;  
 
subject to the relevant Conditions (set out in the Information Memorandum) 
Title: 
Entry of the name of the person in the Register in respect of a Subordinated Note 
constitutes or passes title to the Subordinated Note and is conclusive evidence of 
3 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
that person's entitlements to receive interest and repayment of principal in the 
manner provided for in the Conditions 
Denomination: 
Subordinated Notes will be issued in a specified denomination of AUD 500,000 
Clearing System: 
The Subordinated Notes will initially be represented by a global note in registered 
form (a Registered Global Note). Registered Global Notes will be deposited with a 
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and will be 
registered in the name of its nominee. Persons holding beneficial interests in 
Registered Global Notes will be entitled or required, as the case may be, under the 
circumstances described below, to receive physical delivery of definitive 
Subordinated Notes. 
Interests in a Registered Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge), in whole 
but not in part, for definitive Subordinated Notes without receipts, interest coupons 
or talons attached only upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event. The Issuer will 
promptly give notice to Subordinated Holders in accordance with the Conditions if an 
Exchange Event occurs. In the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event, 
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any person acting on their behalf 
(acting on the instructions of any holder of an interest in such Registered Global 
Note) may give notice to the Registrar requesting exchange. Any such exchange 
shall occur not later than 10 days after the date of receipt of the first relevant notice 
by the Registrar. 
For so long as any of the Subordinated Notes are represented by a Registered 
Global Note held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each 
person (other than Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) who is for the time being 
shown in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of 
a particular nominal amount of such Subordinated Notes (in which regard any 
certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to 
the nominal amount of such Subordinated Notes standing to the account of any 
person shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes save in the case of manifest 
error) shall be treated by the Issuer, any Paying Agent and any Transfer Agent as 
the holder of such nominal amount of Subordinated Notes for all purposes other 
than with respect to payments on the Subordinated Notes for which purpose the 
registered holder of the relevant Registered Global Note shall be treated by the 
Issuer and any Paying Agent as the holder of such Subordinated Notes in 
accordance with and subject to the terms of the relevant Subordinated Global Note 
and the terms Subordinated Holder and holder of Subordinated Notes and 
related expressions shall be construed accordingly. 
For these purposes, Exchange Event means that (i) the Issuer has been notified 
that both Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business 
for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or 
otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease business or have 
in fact done so and no successor clearing system is available or (ii) the Issuer has or 
will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were 
the Subordinated Notes represented by the Registered Global Note to be in 
definitive form.

Payments: 
Payments of principal, interest and any other amount in respect of the Registered 
Global Notes will, in the absence of provision to the contrary, be made to the person 
shown on the Register as the registered holder of the Registered Global Notes. 
None of the Issuer, any Paying Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility or 
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments or deliveries made on 
account of beneficial ownership interests in the Registered Global Notes or for 
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial 
ownership interests. 
Payment in respect of Subordinated Notes held in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, 
Luxembourg and which are represented by a Registered Global Note will only be 
made in accordance with the rules and procedures for the time being of Euroclear 
and Clearstream, Luxembourg as the case may be. 
Payments of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of the definitive 
Subordinated Notes will, in the absence of provision to the contrary, be made to the 
persons shown on the Register at the close of business on the fifteenth day 
immediately preceding the due date for payment. 
Transfer: 
Subordinated Notes can only be transferred in accordance with the Conditions. 
Subordinated Notes held in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and which 
are represented by a Global Note will only be transferable in accordance with the 
rules and procedures for the time being of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg 
as the case may be. 
Taxes: 
All payments in respect of the Subordinated Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer will 
be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future 
taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (Taxes) 
imposed or levied by or on behalf of Australia unless such Taxes are required by law 
to be withheld or deducted. 
Where any withholding or deduction is required by law, the Issuer must pay such 
additional amounts to the Subordinated Holders that will result in those 
Subordinated Holders receiving the amounts they would have received had no such 
withholding or deduction been required, except that no additional amounts will be 
payable with respect to any Subordinated Note: 
 
if the Subordinated Holder is subject to such Taxes by reason of its being 
connected with the Commonwealth of Australia other than by reason only 
of the holding of the Subordinated Note or the receipt of payment on the 
Subordinated Note; 
 
if the Subordinated Holder is an associate (as that term is defined in the 
Australian Tax Act) of the Issuer and the payment being sought is not, or 
will not be, exempt from interest withholding tax because of section 128F(6) 
of the Australian Tax Act; 
 
presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except 
5 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
to the extent that the Subordinated Holder would have been entitled to 
such additional amounts on presenting such Subordinated Note for 
payment on the last day of such period of 30 days; 
 
if the Subordinated Holder could lawfully avoid (but has not so avoided) 
such deduction or withholding by complying with any statutory 
requirements in force at the present time or in the future or by making a 
declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption; or 
 
for, or on account of any withholding or deduction required pursuant to 
FATCA (defined below). 
FATCA: Holders may be 
subject to FATCA 
withholding and 
information reporting: 
Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
commonly known as FATCA, a foreign financial institution (as defined by FATCA) 
may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (foreign passthru 
payments) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting or related 
requirements. The Issuer is classified as a foreign financial institution. 
A number of jurisdictions (including Australia) have entered into, or have agreed in 
substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement 
FATCA (IGAs), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. 
Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an 
IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA 
from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA 
provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Subordinated Notes, including 
whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with 
respect to payments on instruments such as the Subordinated Notes, are uncertain 
and may be subject to change.  Even if withholding would be required pursuant to 
FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the 
Subordinated Notes, such withholding would not apply prior the date that is two 
years after the date on which final regulations defining foreign passthru payments 
are filed with the U.S. Federal Register and any Subordinated Notes issued on or 
prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining 
foreign passthru payments are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would 
be grandfathered for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified 
after such date (including by reason of a substitution of the issuer).  However, if 
additional Subordinated Notes that are not distinguishable from previously issued 
Subordinated Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and 
are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all 
Subordinated Notes, including the Subordinated Notes offered prior to the expiration 
of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA.  Holders 
should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their 
investment in the Subordinated Notes. In the event any withholding would be 
required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the 
Subordinated Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a 
result of the withholding. 
The impact of FATCA for Australian financial institutions will also depend on 
associated guidance issued by the Australian Taxation Office. Prospective investors 
should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the Issuer and to 
6 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019

payments they may receive in connection with the Subordinated Notes. 
Governing law: 
English law (except for Conditions 3(b), 14(b), 21 and 22 relating to subordination, 
substitution and Exchange or Write-Down upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Event, which will be governed by and construed in accordance with New South 
Wales law) 
Listing: 
Application will be made to the ASX for the Subordinated Notes to be quoted on the 
ASX 
Issue Price: 
100 per cent of the Aggregate Nominal Amount 
Status and ranking: 
Subordinated Notes will be direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the 
Issuer and rank in a winding-up: 
 
after the claims in respect of Senior Ranking Obligations including claims 
preferred by applicable laws; 
 
equally among themselves and with claims in respect of Equal Ranking 
Securities; and 
 
ahead of all claims in respect of Junior Ranking Securities including claims 
referred to in sections 563AA and 563A of the Corporations Act. 
Senior Ranking Obligations means all present and future deposits and other 
liabilities, securities and other obligations of the Issuer which would be entitled to be 
admitted in the winding up of the Issuer (and including but not limited to obligations 
in respect of instruments issued before 1 January 2013 as Tier 2 Capital) other than 
Equal Ranking Securities and Junior Ranking Securities. 
Equal Ranking Securities means any instrument that ranks in a winding up of the 
Issuer as the most junior claim in the winding up of the Issuer ranking senior to 
Junior Ranking Securities, and includes: 
(a) 
if on issue at the commencement of the winding up of the Issuer, the 
JPY20,000,000,000 Perpetual Subordinated Callable Fixed/Floating Rate 
Reverse Dual Currency Securities issued by the Issuer in 1999; and 
(b) 
any other instruments, present and future, issued after 1 January 2013 as 
instruments constituting Tier 2 Capital. 
Junior Ranking Securities means: 
(a) 
any instrument, present and future, issued by the Issuer which qualifies as 
Tier 1 Capital or, in the case of any instrument issued prior to 1 January 
2013, was treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in accordance with the 
prudential standards which applied prior to 1 January 2013, irrespective of 
whether or not such instrument is treated as constituting Tier 1 Capital in 
7 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
accordance with any transitional arrangements provided by APRA or which 
rank or are expressed to rank equally with such securities in a winding up of 
the Issuer; and 
(b) 
all Ordinary Shares of the Issuer. 
The applicable laws which give priority to certain claims include (but are not limited 
to) sections 13A and 16 of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) (Banking Act) and section 
86 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth). These provisions provide that, in the event 
that the Issuer becomes unable to meet its obligations or suspends payment, its 
assets in Australia are to be available to meet its liabilities to, among others, APRA, 
the Reserve Bank of Australia and holders of protected accounts held in Australia, in 
priority to all other liabilities, including the Subordinated Notes. 
Changes to applicable laws may extend the debts required to be preferred by law. 
The Subordinated Notes are not protected accounts or deposit liabilities of the 
Issuer for the purposes of the Banking Act. 
Maturity Date: 
23 September 2034 
Events of Default: 
An event of default (Event of Default) broadly occurs if: 
(a) 
the Issuer fails to pay any amount due in respect of the Subordinated Notes 
and such default continues for a period of 15 Business Days and is 
continuing (except where the non-payment is in compliance with law or 
legal advice or to the extent that, immediately after the payment, the Issuer 
will not be Solvent (in which case such amount still accumulates and 
remains a debt owing to the Noteholder by the Issuer)); or 
(b) 
an order is made by a court of competent jurisdiction (other than an order 
successfully appealed or permanently stayed within 30 Business Days), or 
an effective resolution is passed, for the winding up of the Issuer in 
Australia (but not elsewhere). 
If an Event of Default occurs as described in paragraph (a), any Subordinated 
Holder may institute proceedings: 
 
to recover the amount the Issuer has failed to pay, provided that the Issuer 
may only be compelled to pay that amount to the extent that, immediately 
after the payment, the Issuer will be Solvent (in which case such amount 
still accumulates and remains a debt owing to the Noteholder by the 
Issuer); 
 
for specific performance of any other obligation in respect of the 
Subordinated Note; or 
 
for the winding up of the Issuer in Australia (but not elsewhere). 
If an Event of Default occurs as described in paragraph (b), a Subordinated Holder 
may prove in the winding up of the Issuer in respect of an amount equal to the 
8 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid Interest up to (but excluding) 
the date of commencement of the winding up. 
There are no other Events of Default, and a Subordinated Holder has no right to 
accelerate payment or exercise any other remedy (including any right to sue for 
damages) as a consequence of any Event of Default other than in the circumstances 
described above. 
A winding-up will not occur solely by reason of (i) an application to wind up being 
made or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, administrator or official with similar 
powers under section 13A(1) of the Banking Act. 
Interest: 
The interest rate will be a fixed rate of 3.60 per cent. per annum.  
Interest is payable annually in arrear on 23 September in each year, commencing on 
23 September 2020 up to and including the Maturity Date. 
A Subordinated Note bears interest on its Outstanding Principal Amount, subject to 
the Conditions. 
No interest accrues on Subordinated Notes, or the relevant percentage of 
Subordinated Notes, required to be Exchanged for Ordinary Shares in the period 
from (and including) the Interest Payment Date that immediately precedes the Non-
Viability Trigger Event to the Subordinated Note Exchange Date or Write Down Date 
(as applicable). 
Redemption or 
Repurchase: 
Each Subordinated Note will be Redeemed on the Maturity Date for its Final 
Redemption Amount unless previously Redeemed, Exchanged or Written Down in 
full. 
The Issuer may elect to Redeem all or some Subordinated Notes on the Optional 
Redemption Date in accordance with the Conditions. This option is not exercisable 
before the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date of the Subordinated Notes. 
In certain circumstances following notice by the Issuer, the Issuer may Redeem all 
(but not some) of the Subordinated Notes if there is a material risk that, as a result of 
a change in laws of Australia (including following any announcement of a 
prospective change or amendment which has been or will be introduced) the Issuer 
would be exposed to a more than de minimis adverse tax consequence in relation to 
the Subordinated Notes other than a tax consequence the Issuer expected as at the 
Issue Date. 
In certain circumstances following notice by the Issuer, the Issuer may Redeem all 
(but not some) of the Subordinated Notes if it determines that as a result of a 
change in the laws of Australia or a change in APRAs prudential standards 
(including following any announcement of a prospective change or amendment 
which has been or will be introduced) all or some or a percentage of the 
Subordinated Notes are not or will not be treated as Tier 2 Capital of the Group 
under APRAs prudential standards (as amended from time to time), other than as a 
9 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
result of a change of treatment expected by the Issuer as at the Issue Date. 
The Issuer or any member of the Group may, to the extent permitted by applicable 
laws and regulations, at any time purchase the Subordinated Notes in the open 
market, by tender to all or some of the Subordinated Holders or by private 
agreement or otherwise at any price. 
Early Redemption or Repurchase of the Subordinated Notes is subject to the prior 
written approval of APRA. 
Subordinated Holders should not expect that APRAs approval will be given for any 
early Redemption or Repurchase of Subordinated Notes. 
No Set-Off: 
None of the Issuer, any Subordinated Holder or any person claiming through any of 
them has any right of set-off in respect of any amounts owed by one person to the 
other person. 
Non-Viability Trigger 
Event: 
A Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs when APRA notifies the Issuer in writing that 
it believes: 
(i) 
an Exchange of all or some Subordinated Notes, or conversion or write 
down of capital instruments of the Group, is necessary because, without it, 
the Issuer would become non-viable; or 
(ii) 
a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary 
because, without it, the Issuer would become non-viable. 
APRA may specify an aggregate face value of capital instruments which must be 
Exchanged, Written Down, converted or written down (as applicable). 
Exchange or Write Down 
on the occurrence of a 
Non-Viability Trigger 
Event: 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer must Exchange in accordance 
with the Conditions such number of Subordinated Notes (or, if it so determines, such 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) as is 
equal (taking into account any conversion or write down of other Relevant 
Securities) to the aggregate face value of capital instruments which APRA has 
notified the Issuer must be Exchanged, converted or written down (or, if APRA has 
not so notified the Issuer, such number or, if the Issuer so determines, such 
percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, as is 
necessary to satisfy APRA that the Issuer will no longer be non-viable). If a Non-
Viability Trigger Event occurs in circumstances where APRA believes a public sector 
injection of capital, or equivalent support, is necessary because, without it, the 
Issuer would become non-viable, the Issuer must Exchange all Subordinated Notes. 
In determining the number of Subordinated Notes, or percentage of the Outstanding 
Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note, which must be Exchanged, the Issuer 
will: 
(i) 
first, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant Tier 1

permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before Exchange 
of the Subordinated Notes; 
(ii) 
secondly, exchange, convert or write down the face value of any Relevant 
Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to 
require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down before 
Exchange of the Subordinated Notes; and 
(iii) 
thirdly, if exchange, conversion or write down of those securities is not 
sufficient, Exchange (in the case of the Subordinated Notes) or exchange, 
convert or write down (in the case of any other Relevant Tier 2 Securities) 
on a pro-rata basis or in a manner that is otherwise, in the opinion of the 
Issuer, fair and reasonable, the Subordinated Notes and any other Relevant 
Tier 2 Securities whose terms require or permit, or are taken by law to 
require or permit, them to be exchanged, converted or written down in that 
manner (subject to such adjustments as the Issuer may determine to take 
into account the effect on marketable parcels and whole numbers of 
Ordinary Shares and any Subordinated Notes or other Relevant Tier 2 
Securities remaining on issue), 
 
but such determination will not impede the immediate Exchange of the relevant 
number of Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount 
of each Subordinated Note (as the case may be). 
Subordinated Holders should note that the Issuer has no obligation to issue or keep 
on issue any Relevant Tier 1 Securities or Relevant Tier 2 Securities. 
 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event has occurred and all or some of the Subordinated 
Notes (or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated 
Note) are required to be Exchanged, then: 
(a) 
Exchange of the relevant Subordinated Notes or percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note will occur 
immediately upon the date of occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event; 
and 
(b) 
the entry of the corresponding Subordinated Note in each relevant 
Subordinated Holders holding in the Register will constitute an entitlement 
of that Subordinated Holder (or of the nominee) to the relevant number of 
Ordinary Shares (and if applicable, also to any remaining balance of the 
Subordinated Notes or remaining percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Note). 
If, for any reason, Exchange of any Subordinated Note (or a percentage of the 
Outstanding Principal Amount of any Subordinated Note) required to be Exchanged 
fails to take effect and the Issuer has not otherwise issued the Ordinary Shares 
required to be issued in respect of such Exchange within five Business Days after 
the date of the occurrence of the Non-Viability Trigger Event, then the relevant 
Subordinated Holders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and Interest and the right to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such 
11 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
Subordinated Notes or percentage of the Outstanding Principal Amount of the 
Subordinated Notes are immediately and irrevocably terminated (Written Down) 
and such termination will be taken to have occurred immediately on the date of the 
Non Viability Trigger Event.  The Issuer must give notice as soon as practicable that 
Write Down has occurred to the Registrar and the Subordinated Holders, and the 
notice must specify the date on which the Non-Viability Trigger Event occurred. 
Exchange Mechanics: 
On the Subordinated Note Exchange Date, the Issuer will allot and issue the 
Exchange Number of Ordinary Shares for each Subordinated Note (or percentage of 
the Outstanding Principal Amount of each Subordinated Note) required to be 
Exchanged. The Exchange Number is, subject always to the Exchange Number 
being no greater than the Maximum Exchange Number, calculated according to the 
following formula: 
where: 
P means 0.99. 
VWAP (expressed in Australian dollars and cents) means, broadly, the average 
daily volume weighted prices of Ordinary Shares traded on ASX during the relevant 
VWAP Period. 
VWAP Period means: 
(a) 
in the case of the calculation of the Exchange Number, the period of five 
Ordinary Shares Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took 
place immediately preceding (but not including) the Subordinated Note 
Exchange Date; or 
(b) 
in the case of the Issue Date VWAP, the period of 20 Ordinary Shares 
Business Days on which trading in Ordinary Shares took place immediately 
preceding but excluding the Issue Date. 
Maximum Exchange Number means a number calculated according to the 
following formula: 
Maximum 
Exchange 
Number 
= 
Outstanding Principal Amount  
0.20 x Issue Date VWAP 
The Issue Date VWAP (and accordingly the Maximum Exchange Number) is subject 
to limited adjustments for bonus issues and certain capital reconstructions. 
If the Subordinated Notes of a Subordinated Holder are required to be Exchanged 
Exchange Number = 
Outstanding Principal Amount  
P x VWAP 
12 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
and: 
 
the Subordinated Holder has notified the Issuer that it does not wish to 
receive Ordinary Shares as a result of Exchange, which notice may be 
given at any time on or after the Issue Date and prior to the Subordinated 
Note Exchange Date; 
 
the Subordinated Holder is, broadly, restricted by applicable Australian law 
from holding Ordinary Shares or is considered by the Issuer not to be a 
resident of Australia; or 
 
the Issuer has not received (for any reason whether or not due to the fault 
of that Subordinated Holder) any information required by it so as to impede 
the Issuer issuing the Ordinary Shares, 
then, subject to the Conditions, on the Subordinated Note Exchange Date, the 
Subordinated Holders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and interest, and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to such 
Subordinated Notes being Exchanged are immediately and irrevocably terminated 
and the Issuer will (subject to the Conditions) issue the Exchange Number of 
Ordinary Shares to a nominee (which nominee may not be the Issuer or a Related 
Entity of the Issuer) for no additional consideration on terms that, at the first 
opportunity to sell the Ordinary Shares, the nominee will arrange for their sale at 
market value and pay the Attributable Proceeds to the relevant Subordinated 
Holder. 
Investment Risks: 
This paragraph does not describe all the risks in investing in Subordinated Notes. 
Prospective investors or purchasers should consult their own financial and legal 
advisers about risks associated with an investment in the Subordinated Notes and 
the suitability of investing in the Subordinated Notes in light of their particular 
circumstances. 
Neither the current nor the historical value of euros, commodities, interest rates or 
other indices or formulae should be taken as an indication of future performance of 
euros, commodities, interest rates or other indices or formulae during the term of 
any Subordinated Notes. 
Additional Non-Viability 
Trigger Event Risk: 
Without in any way limiting the section above titled Investment Risks, certain 
additional risks arise in respect of the Subordinated Notes. 
As outlined in the sections above titled Non-Viability Trigger Event and Exchange 
or Write Down on the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event, Subordinated 
Notes are subject to a Non-Viability Trigger Event that could lead to Subordinated 
Notes being Exchanged or Written Down. 
It should be noted that whether a Non-Viability Trigger Event will occur is at the 
discretion of APRA and there are currently no precedents for this. The 
circumstances in which APRA may exercise its discretion are not limited to when 
APRA may have a concern about a banks capital levels but may also include when 
13 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019 
 
 
For personal use only
 
 
 
 
APRA has a concern about a banks funding and liquidity levels. 
If one, or a combination, of general risks associated with the Issuers businesses 
leads to a significant capital loss, or prolonged difficulties in raising funding or 
maintaining sufficient liquidity, the Issuer believes this may be the type of situation in 
which APRA becomes concerned and notifies the Issuer that it has become non-
viable. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the Issuer must immediately Exchange such 
number of the Subordinated Notes (or a percentage of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount of each Subordinated Note) as specified by APRA or necessary to satisfy 
APRA that the Issuer will no longer be non-viable. In the case of a public sector 
injection of capital, or equivalent support, all Subordinated Notes must be 
Exchanged. The Exchange will be irrevocable. 
If Subordinated Notes are Exchanged following the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, the number of Ordinary Shares received is limited to the Maximum 
Exchange Number. There is a risk that Subordinated Holders will receive a number 
of Ordinary Shares with a value significantly less than the Outstanding Principal 
Amount. 
If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs and Exchange is not effective and the Issuer 
is not otherwise able to issue Ordinary Shares within five Business Days, then 
Subordinated Holders rights (including to payment of the Outstanding Principal 
Amount and Interest and to receive Ordinary Shares) in relation to Subordinated 
Notes being Exchanged are immediately and irrevocably terminated. Subordinated 
Holders investment will lose all of its value, the Outstanding Principal Amount will 
not be repaid and Subordinated Holders will not receive any compensation. 
If Subordinated Notes are Exchanged following the occurrence of a Non-Viability 
Trigger Event, sale of Ordinary Shares issued on Exchange may be restricted by 
applicable Australian law, including if the Issuer has not issued the disclosure 
required by the Corporations Act for the new Ordinary Shares, then restrictions 
apply on the sale of the new Ordinary Shares to certain investors within 12 months 
of their issue.  However, these restrictions will not apply if CBA makes certain 
compliant disclosures at the time when the Subordinated Notes are issued. 
Subordinated Holders may receive Ordinary Shares on Exchange. The rights and 
liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares are set out in the Constitution and are also 
regulated by the Corporations Act, ASX Listing Rules and other applicable laws. 
Amendments: 
The Issuer may amend the Conditions: 
 
without the consent of Subordinated Holders, as set out in the Conditions, 
including if the amendment is of a formal, technical or minor nature; made 
to cure any ambiguity or correct any manifest error or not materially 
prejudicial to the interests of Subordinated Holders; or to enable the 
substitution of a NOHC as the issuer of the Ordinary Shares on Exchange 
provided certain substitution conditions are satisfied; and 
 
with the consent of Holders, by an Extraordinary Resolution being passed 
14 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 165/2019

at a duly convened meeting. 
Certain amendments may require prior written approval from APRA. Approval is at 
the discretion of APRA and may or may not be given.

Schedule 2  Rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Ordinary Shares may be issued to Subordinated Holders by way of Exchange. Ordinary Shares may also be issued to 
a nominee to hold for sale for the benefit of a Subordinated Holder if Exchange occurs and the Subordinated Holder 
has notified CBA that they do not wish to receive Ordinary Shares or the Subordinated Holder is an Ineligible 
Subordinated Holder. 
The rights and liabilities attaching to Ordinary Shares are set out in the constitution of CBA, which is dated 13 
November 2008, and incorporates amendments up to and including all amendments passed at the Annual General 
Meeting on 13 November 2008 (Constitution). The Constitution provides for the following: 
Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares 
Any Ordinary Shares issued to Subordinated Holders by way of Exchange will be fully paid and will rank equally with 
Ordinary Shares already on issue in all respects. 
Transfers 
Subject to the ASX Settlement Operating Rules, transfers of Ordinary Shares are not effective until registered. 
Ordinary Shares are transferable, subject to the ASX Listing Rules, ASX Settlement Operating Rules and the 
Constitution, and the right of the directors of CBA to refuse to register a transfer of Ordinary Shares in limited 
circumstances. 
Unless otherwise required by law or the Constitution, CBA is entitled to treat the registered holder as the absolute 
owner of a share. Ordinary Shares held by a trustee may, with the directors consent, be identified as being subject to 
the relevant trust. 
Except in limited circumstances, CBA is not bound to register more than three persons as joint holders of an Ordinary 
Share. If CBA is required to issue a share certificate for a share by law or the ASX Listing Rules, CBA is not required 
to issue more than one certificate. 
Restrictions apply in respect of persons who become entitled to Ordinary Shares by reason of a holders death or 
bankruptcy. In the case of the death of a holder, the survivor or survivors jointly registered as holders and the legal 
personal representatives of a sole holder are the only persons CBA will recognise as having title to the holders 
interest in the shares. 
Dividends 
Holders of Ordinary Shares may receive dividends if the directors determine that a dividend is payable. CBA may not 
pay a dividend unless CBAs assets exceed its liabilities, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the 
shareholders of CBA as a whole and the payment does not materially prejudice the ability of CBA to pay its creditors. 
Payment may also be subject to the rights of holders of securities carrying preferred rights. CBA pays holders with 
registered addresses in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom cash dividends by direct credit. If a direct 
credit payment instruction is not provided, the dividend will be held in a non-interest bearing account. CBA also has a 
dividend reinvestment plan for eligible holders. The directors of CBA determine whether or not the dividend 
reinvestment plan operates for each dividend and their decision is announced to ASX. 
Winding up 
On winding up of CBA, holders of Ordinary Shares will participate in the division of any surplus assets of CBA (subject 
to the rights of holders of shares carrying preferred rights).

Meetings 
Holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive notice of, attend and, subject to the Constitution, to vote in person, 
by representative, attorney or proxy at general meetings of CBA. 
On a show of hands, each holder (regardless of the number of shares held) has one vote. On a poll, each holder has 
one vote for each fully paid Ordinary Share held. 
Issue of further shares 
The directors of CBA control the issue of shares. Subject to the Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rules, the directors 
may issue further shares, and grant rights or options over shares, on such terms as they think fit. 
Restrictions of ownership of Ordinary Shares 
Australian laws including financial sector and foreign ownership and takeover laws impose certain limitations on the 
right of persons to hold, own or vote on Ordinary Shares. 
Variation of the Constitution 
CBA may seek approval by special resolution of holders of Ordinary Shares (passed by at least 75% of the votes cast 
by members entitled to vote on the resolution) to vary the Constitution. 
CBA is seeking shareholder approval for amendments to the Constitution, as explained in CBAs Notice of Meeting 
lodged with ASX on 12 September 2019. If approved, the amendments are not expected to materially impact the 
rights attaching to Ordinary Shares described above.

Dear Martin, 
 
For dissemination to the market: 
 
CBA Instalments (STWIYE and STWIYF series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in SPDR S&P/ASX 200 FUND (STW) with ASX Codes STWIYE and STWIYF, 
declared the record date for entitlements to the estimated $0.838779, 0% franked dividend for the 
STW Commonwealth Bank Instalments to be 30 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for 
the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 27 September 2019. Again, this 
coincides with the ex-dividend date for the STW ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of STW Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from STW on 11 October 
2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the consolidation. You should review further information 
from http://www.spdrs.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual 
circumstances.  
 
Should you have any queries, please contact your financial adviser or call CommSec on 13 15 20
