Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants

ASX announcement 
APRAs revisions to the related entities 
framework 
 
Tuesday, 20 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today notes the release by Australian 
Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) on revisions to the related entities framework for Authorised Deposit-taking 
institutions (ADIs).  
The reforms include broadening the definition of related entities, a reduction to the limits on exposures to related 
entities and revisions to the Extended Licensed Entities (ELE) framework. The new requirements will be effective from 
1 January 2021. 
APRA confirmed that, among other changes, it will reduce the limits for Australian ADIs exposures to related entities 
from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital.  
As previously disclosed, sufficient capacity exists under the reduced limits to accommodate CBAs exposures to its 
related entities, including the additional capital requirement for New Zealand banks proposed by the RBNZ.  
APRAs announcement is available at www.apra.gov.au.
