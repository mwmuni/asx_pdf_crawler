Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants

ASX announcement 
APRAs revisions to the related entities 
framework 
 
Tuesday, 20 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today notes the release by Australian 
Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) on revisions to the related entities framework for Authorised Deposit-taking 
institutions (ADIs).  
The reforms include broadening the definition of related entities, a reduction to the limits on exposures to related 
entities and revisions to the Extended Licensed Entities (ELE) framework. The new requirements will be effective from 
1 January 2021. 
APRA confirmed that, among other changes, it will reduce the limits for Australian ADIs exposures to related entities 
from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital.  
As previously disclosed, sufficient capacity exists under the reduced limits to accommodate CBAs exposures to its 
related entities, including the additional capital requirement for New Zealand banks proposed by the RBNZ.  
APRAs announcement is available at www.apra.gov.au.

ASX announcement 
Update on divestment of Australian life 
insurance business 
Friday, 23 August 2019 (SYDNEY): Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) today announced that it has entered 
into further agreements to progress the planned divestment of its Australian life insurance business (CommInsure 
Life) to AIA Group Limited (AIA). 
 
The planned divestment has been subject to ongoing regulatory approval processes, which has led to an extended 
period of uncertainty for CommInsure Life. 
 
The revised transaction path comprises a joint co-operation agreement, reinsurance arrangements, partnership 
milestone payments and a statutory asset transfer. The aggregate proceeds for CBA from the transaction are 
expected to be $2,375m,1 a reduction of $150m from the original sale price. These arrangements are expected to be 
implemented in a staged manner throughout FY20, with CBA to receive approximately $750 million of proceeds and 
distributions by the end of 1H FY20 and the remaining $1,625 million by the end of FY20. 
 
CBA and ASB have also agreed to grant AIA an option to extend the respective Australian and New Zealand 
distribution agreements from 20 years to 25 years.  
 
CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said: Todays announcement provides CommInsure Lifes policyholders 
and staff with more clarity about the future of the business and progresses the simplification of CBAs portfolio of 
businesses. 
 
We are excited by the opportunity to bring together the strengths of AIA and CommInsure Life and are working hard 
with our partner to develop a new generation of products for CBAs customers, which will deliver excellent customer 
outcomes. 
 
The revised transaction path is subject to a number of Australian regulatory approvals, the entry into reinsurance 
arrangements and life insurance entity board approvals. 
 
Details of the revised transaction path 
The revised transaction path comprises the following key components: 
Joint co-operation agreement 
 
CBA and AIA will enter into a joint co-operation agreement, which once implemented, will result in the full 
economic interests associated with CommInsure Life (excluding in relation to the Groups 37.5% equity interest 
in BoCommLife Insurance Company Limited (BoCommLife)) being transferred to AIA and AIA obtaining an 
appropriate level of direct management and oversight of the business. AIA Australia & New Zealand CEO 
Damien Mu will lead CommInsure Life under these arrangements.  
 
Implementation of the joint co-operation agreement is expected before the end of 1H FY20 (Implementation 
Date), at which time CBA will receive an upfront payment of $500 million. 
                                            
1 Subject to completion adjustments.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia  |  Media Release 152/2019 
 
Reinsurance 
 
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (CMLA), the key life insurance entity of CommInsure Life, 
intends to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with a leading global reinsurer.  
 
The reinsurance arrangement would come into effect on the Implementation Date and is expected to result in 
CBA receiving a distribution from CMLA of approximately $200 million shortly following the Implementation 
Date. 
Partnership milestones  
 
CBA will receive four partnership milestone payments of $50 million each ($200 million in aggregate), to reflect 
the progress in the partnership, with the first payment expected to be received in late 1H FY20. 
Completion 
 
In parallel with the planned share sale of CommInsure Life (which remains subject to a foreign regulatory 
approval process), CBA and AIA are progressing a potential statutory asset transfer as an alternative approach 
to completing the divestment of the business. If implemented, the statutory asset transfer would be expected to 
take approximately 9 months to implement. 
 
Upon completion, whether achieved through a share sale or statutory asset transfer, CBA will receive a final 
payment from AIA of approximately $1,475 million (subject to completion adjustments). 
 
Financial impacts 
Upon completion, which is expected to occur by the end of FY20, the revised transaction path is expected to have 
released approximately $1.6 billion  $1.8 billion of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, resulting in a pro forma 
increase to the Groups CET1 ratio of approximately 35  40 basis points on an APRA basis as at 30 June 2019. 
 
Sale of equity interest in BoCommLife 
CBA remains committed to completing the sale of the Groups 37.5% equity interest in BoCommLife to MS&AD 
Insurance Group Holdings. Completion of the sale of the BoCommLife equity interest remains subject to regulatory 
approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and CBA is working constructively 
with CBIRC in relation to the process. For the avoidance of doubt, the revised transaction path in relation to 
CommInsure Life does not impact this sale process and CBA will continue to exercise full control over the 
BoCommLife equity interest until its sale has been completed.

Dear Martin, 
 
For dissemination to the market: 
 
CBA Instalments (WESIYE series) 
 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) Equity Products Group, as the Issuer of Instalment Warrants 
over ordinary shares in Wesfarmers Limited (WES) with ASX Codes WESIYE, declared the record 
date for entitlements to the $0.78, 100% franked dividend for the WES Commonwealth Bank 
Instalments to be 2 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 30 August 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the WES ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of WES Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from WES on 9 October 
2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.wesfarmers.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual 
circumstances.  
 
Should you have any queries, please contact your financial adviser or call CommSec on 13 15 20 
(8am to 5pm AEDT, Monday to Friday). 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
Equity Products Group

be 6 September 2019, coinciding with the record date for the ordinary shares. 
 
The CBA Instalments will commence trading ex-dividend on 5 September 2019. Again, this coincides 
with the ex-dividend date for the ASX ordinary shares. 
 
The Trustee will cause payment of the dividend to holders of ASX Commonwealth Bank Instalments 
to coincide, so far as is reasonably practicable, with receipt of the dividend from ASX on 25 
September 2019. 
 
 
Further Information 
Commonwealth Bank does not make any representation as to the taxation consequences for 
Instalment Warrant holders as a result of the dividend. You should review further information from 
www.asx.com.au and consult your own taxation advisers with regard to your individual circumstances.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to invite you to attend the 
2019 AGM of the Commonwealth Bank 
ofAustralia. 
In the 2019 financial year we have 
made significant progress on our 
strategy to become a simpler, better 
bank and have been addressing key 
governance, accountability, risk and 
remediationissues.
Becoming a simpler, better bank
We are becoming a simpler, more focused 
bank that is aligned to meeting the needs 
of customers in our core markets. This 
year our focus has been on our Wealth 
Management division where we have  
been remediating past issues and  
making progress on our plans to exit  
our wealthbusinesses. 
We sold our New Zealand life insurance 
business, Sovereign, in July 2018 for 
$1.3billion; and in August this year, 
completed the sale of our global asset 
management business, Colonial First  
State Global Asset Management 
(CFSGAM), for $4.2 billion.
We are making progress on the sales of 
our life insurance businesses in Australia, 
China and Indonesia. We are also exiting 
our aligned financial advice businesses. 
We expect the sale of Count Financial to 
complete in October, are ceasing our  
CFP-Pathways business, and have 
commenced the assisted closure of 
Financial Wisdom. By simplifying our 
portfolio of businesses we are reducing 
risk and cost and creating the capacity 
toinvest in our corebankingbusinesses.
We have also been working to become 
a better bank, and to deliver better 
outcomes for our customers. This year, we 
have been committed to fixing past failings 
and to compensating impacted customers 
quickly. To deliver on our purpose of 
improving customers financial wellbeing 
we have been removing and reducing 
fees and charges, and have introduced 
smart alerts to help customers avoid fees. 
Improvements have also been made to the 
way we listen and respond to customers, 
including the implementation of a more 
robust complaints handling process. 
Executive leadership
This financial year marks the first full 
year of Matt Comyn as Chief Executive 
Officer of the Bank. Matt has built a new 
experienced leadership team that is 
working to deliver cultural change and the 
Banks strategy. 
Governance, culture and accountability
Much work has been done to strengthen 
governance, culture and accountability 
at the Bank. Most recently, this work has 
been guided by the recommendations 
of last years Australian Prudential 
Regulation Authority (APRA) Prudential 
Inquiry into CBA and we have been 
working systematically to deliver all of the 
milestones in the resulting APRA-endorsed 
Remedial Action Plan. The key focus this 
year has been to improve the governance 
and management of non-financial risk, 
including operational risk and compliance. 
We have implemented the Banking 
Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR).

For personal use only
We have also been making changes 
to our business in response to the 
recommendations of the Final Report of 
the Royal Commission into Misconduct in 
the Banking, Superannuation and Financial 
Services Industry. As the supporting 
legislative and regulatory changes are 
made, we will continue to work with our 
regulators and government to implement 
the recommendations. 
Remuneration
Remuneration plays an important role 
in reinforcing the achievement of the 
Banks priorities. Over the past three 
years, remuneration consequences 
and changes to our performance and 
remuneration framework reflect a strong 
focus on reinforcing greater accountability, 
to support cultural change and better 
customer and risk outcomes across  
the Bank.
Over the 2017 and 2018 financial years 
there was a reduction of more than  
$100 million in remuneration outcomes 
for Directors, Executives, senior leaders 
and employees. These consequences 
were applied to reinforce individual and 
collective accountability for the reputation 
of the Bank, the findings of the APRA 
Prudential Inquiry, and poor customer and 
risk outcomes.
This financial year we have continued 
to add more rigour and challenge to 
the risk assessment process which is 
a key consideration when determining 
remuneration outcomes. Of the 15 
Executives eligible for a short-term 
variable remuneration award, 14 received 
in-year reductions in relation to risk and 
reputational matters, including the CEO.
All Group Executives also experienced a 
reduction in their variable remuneration 
outcomes due to shareholder and 
customer outcomes, including as a 
consequence of the impact of customer 
remediation provisions on this years 
financial performance.
Sustainable business practice
We are committed to acting sustainably 
and responsibly in the long-term interests 
of the economy and broader community.
This year we have integrated our 
environmental and social commitments 
into a single Group Environmental and 
Social Policy. This policy includes our 
commitment to supporting the responsible 
global transition to net zero emissions 
 including by reducing our exposures 
to thermal coal mining and coal fired 
power generation, with a view to exiting 
the sectors by 2030, subject to Australia 
having a secure energy platform. The 
policy also incorporates our human 
rights commitments and our approach to 
managing the risks of modern slavery in 
our business operations and supply chains.
Financial performance
In the 2019 financial year, the Bank 
reported a net profit after tax of 
$8,571million on a statutory basis and 
$8,492million on a cash basis.1 
While this years result has been impacted 
by the actions we have taken to deliver 
better customer and risk outcomes 
 including customer remediation 
costs, revenue forgone for the benefit 
of customers, and elevated risk and 
compliance costs  it also reflects the 
continued performance and strength of 
our underlying business. The strength of 
our balance sheet was particularly evident 
this year. As at 30 June 2019, our Common 
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 10.7%, 
above APRAs unquestionably strong 
benchmark of 10.5%. The sale of CFSGAM 
in August has since delivered a further 
68basis points of CET1. 
This performance has enabled the  
Board to declare a final dividend of 
$2.31per share, taking the full year 
dividend to $4.31per share fully franked, 
flat on last year. The final dividend is 
payable on 26 September 2019.
Board renewal
In January, we welcomed Professor 
Genevieve Bell and Paul OMalley to 
the Board. Both will stand for election 
at this AGM with the support of the 
Board. Current Non-Executive Directors, 
MaryPadbury and Shirish Apte, will stand 
for re-election, again with the support of 
the Board. 
Sir David Higgins will retire from the Board 
on 31 December 2019, after more than five 
years of service. I would like to thank Sir 
David for his commitment and contribution. 
Paul will succeed Sir David as Chairman 
of the People & Remuneration Committee 
from 1 January 2020.
Items of business 
The Notice of Meeting for the AGM 
commences on page 8 of this document 
and outlines the items of business that we 
will put to shareholders for consideration. 
Background information on these 
items is contained in the Explanatory 
Memorandum on pages 10 to 15, which

ITEM 3
Adoption of the 2019 Remuneration 
Report
Section 250R of the Corporations Act 2001 
(Cth) (Act) requires a listed company to 
put a resolution to shareholders to adopt 
its Remuneration Report for the relevant 
financial year. 
The Companys Remuneration Report for 
the financial year ended 30 June 2019 can 
be found at pages 82 to 108 of the 2019 
Annual Report. It sets out the performance 
and remuneration for the Companys 
KMP (who comprise the Companys 
Non-Executive Directors, the Managing 
Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
Group Executives, the CEO ASB and 
OtherExecutives1).
The Companys remuneration framework 
is designed to align executive and 
shareholder interests, retain talent and 
support long term value creation by 
providing employees with competitive 
remuneration and rewards for sustainable 
long term performance. The Board 
obtains independent advice on the 
appropriateness of these arrangements. 
The Board also recognises the pivotal role 
that remuneration can play in managing 
risk, contributing to the achievement of 
positive risk management, and outcomes 
to support the Groups consequence 
management framework. The Board 
places a high importance on accountability, 
with remuneration consequences being 
applied when risk and conduct standards 
are not met. 
During the 2019 financial year, a number 
of changes were implemented in order 
to strengthen the link between risk 
management and remuneration outcomes, 
including:
 An Exceptionally Managed category 
being added to the risk assessment 
scale, to ensure the risk assessment 
process promotes and recognises 
effective risk behaviours, supporting 
positive cultural change.
 Introduction of concurrent Board 
Committee meetings during which 
material financial and non-financial 
risks relevant to executive performance 
and remuneration are collectively 
considered across all Committees.
 Updated remuneration mix for the 
Group Chief Risk Officer to now differ 
from other Group Executives and 
further support his independent status 
from the Groups business activities 
The vote on this Item is advisory only 
and does not bind the Directors or 
theCompany. 
The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote in favour of this Item.
ITEM 4
Grant of Securities to Matt Comyn 
ASX Listing Rule 10.14 requires shareholder 
approval for the acquisition of securities 
by a director under an employee incentive 
scheme. Securities include shares and 
rights to acquire shares. While it is currently 
intended that shares will be acquired 
on market as opposed to issuing new 
shares to satisfy any award that vests, 
shareholder approval is being sought, 
both for good governance and to preserve 
flexibility in case, for any reason, it is 
ultimately considered in the Companys 
best interests to issue shares rather than 
source them on market. 
Approval is sought to grant Matt Comyn, 
the Companys Managing Director and 
CEO, rights under the Companys EEP 
as his long-term variable remuneration 
(LTVR) award. LTVR forms part of the 
Companys remuneration strategy 
for the CEO, with market competitive 
remuneration at risk and in alignment with 
shareholder interests. 
It is proposed that a maximum of 47,957 
rights will be granted to Matt Comyn. 
The rights entitle Matt Comyn to receive 
shares, or a cash equivalent payment, 
as determined by the Board, subject to 
vesting conditions, including satisfaction  
of the performance hurdles set out  
below over the period from 1 July 2019 to 
30 June 2023 (the Performance Period). 
The LTVR award aims to focus efforts on 
achieving superior performance for the 
Companys key stakeholder groups, being 
its customers, community, employees and 
shareholders. Participants in the LTVR 
award for the financial year ending 30 
June 2020 comprise Matt Comyn and the 
Companys Group Executives. The CEO 
ASB will also participate in the LTVR award 
for the financial year ending 30 June 2020 
with performance measures relevant to 
the ASB business. Details will be provided 
in the 2020 Annual Report. No other 
Directors are entitled to participate in the 
LTVR award. 
Further details about the rights to be 
offered to Matt Comyn, and the applicable 
performance measures for the LTVR 
award, are set out below.
LTVR award
Matt Comyns 2020 financial year LTVR 
award will be determined according to 
three performance measures:
1. Total Shareholder Returns: 75% of the 
award, a maximum number of 35,969 
rights, will be subject to a performance 
measure that ranks the Companys 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
relative to a peer group comprising 
the 20 largest companies by market 
capitalisation listed on the ASX on 1 July 
2019, excluding resources companies 
and CBA. 
 
The TSR peer group comprises Amcor 
Limited, Aristocrat Leisure Limited, ASX 
Limited, Australia and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited, Brambles 
Limited, Coles Group Limited, CSL 
Limited, Goodman Group, Insurance 
Australia Group Limited, Macquarie 
Group Limited, National Australia 
Bank Limited, QBE Insurance Group 
Limited, Scentre Group, Suncorp 
Group Limited, Sydney Airport, Telstra 
Corporation Limited, Transurban Group, 
Wesfarmers Limited, Westpac Banking 
Corporation, and Woolworths Group 
Limited.
2. Trust and Reputation: 12.5% of the 
award, a maximum number of 5,994 
rights, will be measured against 
the RepTrak Pulse Score Survey 
conducted by the Reputation Institute, 
which uses four equally weighted 
questions to test the trust, respect 
and admiration a respondent has for 
a particular company. The Companys 
score over the Performance Period is 
compared with, and ranked against, 
the performance over the same period 
of a peer group of 16 of the largest 
consumer-facing companies listed 
on the ASX by market capitalisation.

Other Executives include Michael Venter (Chief Operating Officer Wealth Management) and all Acting Group Executives.

Explanatory 
Memorandum
For personal use only
The peer group excludes resource 
companies, companies that are 
not familiar to the general public, 
companies that do not operate 
nationally, and CBA. A positive TSR 
gateway must be achieved before 
any rights subject to this performance 
measure can vest to ensure that no 
vesting occurs unless the change  
in shareholder value over the period 
ispositive.
 
The peer group comprises AGL Energy 
Limited, Australia and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited, Coles Group 
Limited, Crown Resorts Limited, 
Insurance Australia Group Limited, 
Macquarie Group Limited, Medibank 
Private Limited, National Australia Bank 
Limited, Qantas Airways Limited, QBE 
Insurance Group Limited, Stockland 
Corporation Ltd, Suncorp Group 
Limited, Telstra Corporation Limited, 
Wesfarmers Limited, Westpac Banking 
Corporation, and Woolworths Group 
Limited.
3. Employee Engagement: 12.5% of the 
award, a maximum number of 5,994 
rights, will be measured against an 
Employee Engagement performance 
measure. Employees are invited to 
participate in an externally conducted 
survey. Employee Engagement is 
based on the proportion of employees 
responding that they strongly 
agree or agree with four questions 
relating to satisfaction, commitment, 
advocacy and pride (each of which 
is equally weighted). Employee 
Engagement will be measured based 
on the improvement of the Companys 
Employee Engagement outcomes 
over the Performance Period. The 
surveys will be conducted by an 
independent provider who will facilitate 
and collate the results. A positive TSR 
gateway must be achieved before 
any rights subject to this performance 
measure can vest to ensure that no 
vesting occurs unless the change in 
shareholder value over the period is 
positive.
In addition, the LTVR award will be subject to a risk and reputation review by the Board 
before any vesting occurs. This ensures that the outcomes that would otherwise be 
delivered based on performance against the performance measures appropriately 
considers the Banks risk and reputation outcomes.
The number of rights that vest for each performance hurdle will be determined as set  
out below:

For personal use only
The Board may change the peer group 
companies listed above, for example, if  
one of the peer group companies 
ceases to be listed on the ASX during the 
performance period. The next largest ASX 
listed companies by market capitalisation 
at the being of the performance period 
provides the reserve bench. 
How many rights will be granted  
to Matt Comyn?
A maximum of 47,957 rights will be granted 
to Matt Comyn. This number has been 
determined by dividing his maximum 
LTVR opportunity for each tranche by the 
volume weighted average price (VWAP) 
of the Companys ordinary shares over the 
five trading days up to 1 July 2019 (being 
$82.57)). 
If the Company makes a bonus issue or 
rights issue or undertakes a corporate 
action or capital reconstruction, the Board 
may adjust the number or value of the 
rights granted to Matt Comyn to ensure 
no material advantage or disadvantage 
occurs, subject to any ASX Listing Rule 
requirements. Any such adjustments will 
be explained in the Companys Annual 
Report issued following the adjustment. 
Each of the LTVR performance measures 
will be tested following the end of the 
Performance Period (i.e. after year ending 
30 June 2023). The total number of rights 
(if any) that vest will be the aggregate of the 
rights that vest against each performance 
measure, subject to the discretion retained 
by the Board. 
The total award is subject to a risk and 
reputation review. The Board retains 
discretion to determine the amount and 
form of any award that may vest (if any). 
The Board has discretion to determine 
that some or all of the award will lapse in 
certain circumstances, including where,  
in the opinion of the Board:
 
the vesting of rights is not justified or 
supportable having regard to Matt 
Comyns performance and/or conduct 
or the performance of the Company  
as a whole; or
 
the vesting of rights will impact on the 
financial soundness of the Company  
or one of its subsidiaries; or
 
the Company is required or entitled to 
reclaim remuneration or reduce Matt 
Comyns remuneration outcome under 
law, regulation or Company policy; or
 
a significant unexpected or unintended 
consequence or outcome has occurred 
which impacts the Company.
When will the rights be granted?
The rights will be granted to Matt Comyn 
following the 2019 AGM, and in any event 
no later than 12 months after the AGM. 
Is Matt Comyn required to pay for 
therights?
The rights will be granted to Matt Comyn  
at no cost. Matt Comyn will not be 
provided with any loans in relation to his 
acquisition of securities under the EEP.
Is Matt Comyn entitled to dividends?
Prior to vesting, rights do not carry any 
voting or dividend (or equivalent payment) 
rights. Any shares allocated to Matt Comyn 
on vesting of the rights will carry the same 
rights (including with respect to voting and 
dividends) as other ordinary shares in  
the Company. This means that Matt Comyn 
will only receive dividends that are paid 
from the time any rights vest as shares. 
Treatment of shares and rights  
if Matt Comyn leaves the Company
In general, if Matt Comyn ceases 
employment before the rights vest, unless 
the Board determines otherwise, his 
unvested rights will remain on foot and the 
vesting conditions will be tested in  
the ordinary course following the end of 
the Performance Period . In the case  
of termination of employment for cause, 
unless the Board determines otherwise, 
the unvested rights will lapse.
Any rights granted under this award that 
do not vest when tested following the end 
of the Performance Period will lapse.
Participation under previous approvals
At the 2018 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders approved the granting to 
Matt Comyn of rights under the EEP. Matt 
Comyn was subsequently granted 54,364 
rights which are subject to the terms of the 
2019 financial year LTVR award. No price  
is or was payable for the acquisition of 
those rights. No other rights have been 
granted to a Director under the EEP or any 
other employee incentive scheme, since 
the 2018 Annual General Meeting. 
If approval is given under ASX Listing Rule 
10.14, approval is not required under ASX 
Listing Rule 7.1.
The Board (with Matt Comyn abstaining) 
recommends that shareholders vote  
in favour of this Item.
ITEM 5
Adoption of a new Constitution
The Companys current Constitution 
was last amended at the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting. It is proposed to adopt 
a new Constitution as there have been a 
number of developments in law, corporate 
governance principles and general 
corporate and commercial practice for 
ASX listed companies since that time.
The Board recommends the adoption of 
a new Constitution which reflects current 
market practice and terminology. Many of 
the proposed changes are administrative 
or relatively minor in nature. The material 
differences between the current 
Constitution and the new Constitution 
areoutlined below.
Share capital and variation of 
classrights
The preference share provisions in rule 
2.2 of the new Constitution are less 
prescriptive than the equivalent provisions 
under the current Constitution, conferring 
greater flexibility regarding the terms of 
any preference shares issued in the future. 
Proposed rule 2.5(b) of the new 
Constitution sets out the rules relating 
to separate class meetings such that 
a quorum is at least 2 persons holding 
or representing at least one third of the 
issued shares of the class or, if there is one 
holder of shares in a class, that person. 
Any holder of shares of the class present, 
or the chair of the meeting, may demand 
a poll. 
Calls, forfeiture, indemnities, 
lienandsurrender
Currently, the Company has a default fixed 
interest rate of 15% p.a. (or such other 
rate as the Directors may determine) in 
respect of amounts which may be owed 
by shareholders. Under rule 3.9 of the 
new Constitution, this default fixed rate 
would be replaced by a floating interest 
rate based on the penalty interest rate 
set under legislation (or if the Board has 
fixed a rate, that rate). Proposed rules 3.4, 
3.5 and 3.6 also clarify the ability of the 
Board to exempt shares from forfeiture, 
lien and the members indemnity under 
the Constitution (should circumstances 
warrant it).

Memorandum

Dividends 
The Companys current Constitution 
has separate provisions for interim and 
final dividends and adopts a range of 
terminology to describe how the Company 
pays dividends. Rule 4.1 of the new 
Constitution harmonises these provisions 
and adopts the generic term dividend to 
avoid any potential technical distinctions 
interminology.
Proposed rule 4.1 also introduces scope 
for the Company to reinvest unclaimed 
dividends, for the benefit of the relevant 
shareholder, into shares in the Company 
after a period of time has elapsed. The 
existing equivalent rule in the Companys 
current Constitution provides that 
unclaimed money can be used for the 
benefit of the Company until such time as 
it is claimed or disposed of in accordance 
with the law.
Transfer and transmission of shares
The Companys current constitutional 
provisions regarding unmarketable parcels 
of shares impose time limitations which are 
not required under the ASX Listing Rules. 
These restrictions are removed in the new 
Constitution which more closely reflects 
the requirements of the ASX Listing Rules. 
New rule 5.4 clarifies that the Board may, 
in certain circumstances, revoke a notice 
given in relation to an unmarketableparcel.
General meetings
The new Constitution incorporates a 
number of changes to assist with the 
orderly conduct of general meetings of 
theCompany.
Rule 6.6 of the new Constitution expressly 
confirms the Chairmans power to not 
put certain resolutions to the meeting, 
notwithstanding they may have been listed 
in the notice of meeting. 
New rule 6.7 provides that a matter will be 
decided on a poll without first being put  
to the meeting on a show of hands where 
the matter is set out in the notice of 
meeting or any other circumstance where 
the Chairman determines it appropriate. 
Directors
The Companys current Constitution 
requires one third of the Board to stand 
for election at each AGM. The new 
Constitution will remove this rule to bring 
the Companys Constitution in line with 
the ASX Listing Rules, which require 
an election of Directors each year and 
that a Director must not hold office 
(without re-election) past the third annual 
general meeting following the Directors 
appointment or three years, whichever 
islonger.
The rules in the new Constitution 
relating to Directors remuneration 
are broadly in line with the rules in the 
current Constitution. Rule 7.3 of the new 
Constitution clarifies that in calculating 
the maximum fees payable to Directors, 
superannuation contributions made to 
comply with superannuation guarantee 
legislation are included in the aggregate 
fee cap.
The current Constitution provides that 
the quorum for a Directors meeting is 
one half of the total number of Directors 
for the time being in office (rounded 
upwards if not a whole number), or three, 
whichever is greater. The new Constitution 
provides that unless the Board decides 
differently, the quorum is one half of the 
total number of Directors for the time 
being in office who are not excluded 
(rounded upwards if not a whole number) 
or three, whichever is greater. A Director 
will be excluded where (i) they are on a 
leave of absence approved by the Board, 
(ii) they have notified the Chairman or the 
Group Company Secretary they may be 
uncontactable for a certain period of time 
and the Board meeting is held during that 
period, (iii) they are incapacitated (e.g. 
due to ill health), (iv) they have disqualified 
themselves from considering the relevant 
item(s) of business at a Board meeting, or 
(v) they would be prohibited under the Act 
or other laws or regulations from voting on 
the relevant item(s) of business.
Directors can pass written resolutions 
of the Board where (i) all Directors (other 
than those excluded as outlined below) 
sign or consent to the resolution, and 
(ii) the Directors who sign or consent to 
the resolution would have constituted a 
quorum at the meeting.
Directors will be excluded where (i) they 
are on a leave of absence approved by the 
Board, (ii) they have notified the Chairman 
or the Group Company Secretary they 
may be uncontactable during the period 
the resolution is being considered, (iii) they 
are incapacitated (e.g. due to ill health), 
(iv) they have disqualified themselves 
from considering the resolution or (v) they 
would be prohibited under the Act or other 
laws or regulations from voting on the 
resolution. All Directors are expected to 
attend all Board meetings and participate 
in Board decisions.
Notices
The Companys existing rules regarding 
giving notice to shareholders provide that, 
aside from the notice of meeting, notice 
will be served on the day that it would 
arrive in the ordinary course of the post. 
Rule 13.4 of the new Constitution adopts 
a standard ASX listed company approach 
to members notices and simplifies 
administration by providing that a notice 
from the Company properly addressed 
and posted, is taken to be served at 
10.00am Sydney time on the day after 
thedate it is posted. 
General Updates
Rules which were outdated or restated 
Act or ASX Listing Rule requirements have 
been removed to simplify the document 
and minimise the need for updates in 
the event of any legislative or regulatory 
change. The provisions of the Constitution 
have been amended to reflect changes 
in terminology now contained in the Act, 
the ASX Listing Rules and ASX Settlement 
Operating Rules. 
The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote in favour of this Item.

LODGEMENT OF A VOTING/PROXY FORM
HOW TO COMPLETE THIS VOTING/PROXY FORM
YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS
This is your name and address as it appears on the Companys share register. If 
this information is incorrect, please make the correction on this form. Shareholders 
sponsored by a broker should advise their broker of any changes. Please note: 
you cannot change ownership of your shares using this form.
METHOD A  VOTE DIRECTLY
If you mark the box in METHOD A, you are indicating that you wish to vote directly. 
Please mark either For, Against or Abstain for an Item for your vote to be 
counted on that Item. If you vote on at least one Item but leave other Item(s) blank, 
the vote on the Item(s) marked will be valid but no vote will be counted or treated as 
being cast for the Item(s) left blank. If you mark more than one box on an Item, your 
vote on the Item will be invalid. If no voting instructions are given on all of the Items 
then the Chairman of the Meeting will be deemed to be your appointed proxy.
If you mark the boxes in both METHOD A and METHOD B then METHOD B is 
deemed to be the chosen method. The person named will be your proxy, or if no 
person is named, the Chairman of the Meeting will be your appointed proxy.
If you have lodged a direct vote, and then attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting, your direct vote will be cancelled. Attending the Annual General Meeting 
only will not invalidate your direct vote.
The Chairmans decision as to whether a direct vote is valid is conclusive.
METHOD B  APPOINT A PROXY
If you wish to appoint the Chairman of the Meeting as your proxy, mark the box 
in METHOD B. If you wish to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the 
Meeting as your proxy, please write the name of that person or body corporate in 
the box provided. If you leave this section blank, or your named proxy does not 
attend the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman of the Meeting will be your 
proxy. If your named proxy attends the Annual General Meeting but does not vote 
on a poll on an Item in accordance with your directions, the Chairman of the 
Meeting will become your proxy in respect of that Item. A proxy need not be a 
shareholder of the Company. A proxy may be an individual or a body corporate.
VOTES ON ITEMS OF BUSINESS  PROXY APPOINTMENT
You should direct your proxy how to vote by placing a mark in one of the boxes 
opposite each Item of Business. All your shares will be voted in accordance with 
such a direction, unless you indicate only a portion of voting rights are to be voted 
on any Item by inserting the percentage or number of shares you wish to vote in 
the appropriate box or boxes. If you do not mark any of the boxes on the Items of 
Business, your proxy may vote, or abstain from voting, as he or she chooses. If 
you mark more than one box on an Item, your vote on that Item will be invalid.
APPOINTMENT OF A SECOND PROXY
If you are a shareholder entitled to cast two or more votes, you are entitled to 
appoint up to two persons as proxies to attend the Annual General Meeting and 
vote on a poll. If you wish to appoint a second proxy, an additional Voting/Proxy 
Form may be obtained by telephoning the Companys share registry or you may 
copy this form. 
To appoint a second proxy you must:
(a) on each of the first Voting/Proxy Form and the second Voting/Proxy Form, 
state the percentage of your voting rights or number of shares applicable to 
that form. If the appointments do not specify the percentage or number of 
votes that each proxy may exercise, each proxy may exercise half your votes. 
Fractions of votes will be disregarded; and
(b) return both forms together.
SIGNING INSTRUCTIONS
You must sign this form as follows in the spaces provided:
Individual: where the holding is in one name, the holder must sign.
